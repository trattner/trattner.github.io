I'm an Engineer with the heart of an Educator and the spirit of an Entrepreneur. My mission is to accelerate human intelligence by empowering people and unlocking our collective potential. I'm grateful for my background and strong relationships which enable me to pursue this end uniquely well.

- interned at an [early-stage Boston-based VC firm](https://www.pillar.vc/),
- cofounded the mental health nonprofit [Lean On Me](https://lean0n.me/){:target="_blank"},
- conducted structural analysis in the 3D-printing group at Northrop Grumman for the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope){:target="_blank"},

This site started as a blog inspired by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2019/06/writing-not-plastics-not-wall-street/){:target="_blank"}. I've been calling it "ALT Thoughts" (my initials).

After writing an average of 10 posts each month in 2019&mdash;mostly regurgitating Seth&mdash;I decided it was time to choose: go all-in and blog my heart out, or publish more personal updates per subscriber requests. The latter has the upper hand for now...monthly personal updates are a go!
