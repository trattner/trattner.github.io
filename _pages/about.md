This blog is 100% inspired by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2015/02/say-something/){:target="_blank"}. So far, my thoughts are a bit more convoluted than his. I'm hoping the daily practice of writing will help me straighten things out! Perhaps this journey is of interest; I'd love for you to [join me](https://forms.gle/TngB7wUG2V2YVB6D9){:target="_blank"}.

I'm fascinated with writing and the technology of language as an art form. I'm interested in individual and collective human experience, potential, and intelligence. What constitutes success, meaning, purpose? What's beautiful? How?

"ALT Thoughts" because it is, quite simply, a collection of thoughts from me, Andrew (Andy) Lam Trattner. The hope is that my observations and perspectives are a bit offbeat, therefore valuable and thought-provoking. I'd like to emphasize the under-valued and call out the over-valued. I'd like to learn and express that which runs counter to the prevailing narrative, conventional wisdom, the everyday mainstream.

Originally, "Empanada.Life" was the name of the game. In an attempt to consolidate resources&mdash;as well as personal inputs, distractions, and outputs&mdash;I've discontinued that URL and decided this site will be my sole public interface online.

It's an appealing ideological stance to own my content and privacy. Also, running a homemade website forces me to act with intention regarding design, etc. See Github for the [source code](https://github.com/trattner/trattner.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm currently working as a customer solutions representative at Clever, which means I provide tech support to over half of all the teachers and administrators in the U.S. In my free time, I help the Mechanics Institute do chess things in the community, and I compete regularly in tournaments as an expert-level player aiming for National Master. Also high on the priority list: reading, learning, thinking, exercise, food, and building flywheels of love with friends and family.

I've been fortunately blessed with many amazing people, opportunities, and experiences in my life. Some fun-fact highlights include remote-controlling a multi-million dollar research experiment on the International Space Station, running the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program for the White House under both Obama and Trump, cofounding the mental health nonprofit [Lean On Me](https://lean0n.me/){:target="_blank"}, working entirely in Spanish on the social media team at a bank in Barcelona, and obtaining a [B.S. in Mathematics with Computer Science from MIT](/img/mit-diploma.png){:target="_blank"} in three years.

Once more, I invite you to [join me](https://forms.gle/TngB7wUG2V2YVB6D9){:target="_blank"} in this journey. I'll send new content to your inbox, and of course, you're welcome to opt-out at any time. I don't know what you will gain, but I hope perhaps an alt perspective, a dose of inspiration, and an ever-deepening connection to a kindred soul in perpetual search of everything...
