I've previously posted [some links to what the Internet has said about me](https://andytrattner.com/February-2020.html#on-social-media-and-google){:target="_blank"}.


I enjoy [cooking](https://github.com/trattner/atratt/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-31-food.md) and I always do the dishes. Once upon a time, [I made a fancy battlebot](https://github.com/trattner/atratt/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-31-battlebot.md). I'm often tempted to play poker [against my best interests](https://github.com/trattner/atratt/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-25-poker-sim.md). I am affectionate towards animals but don't like having pets. I cry during beautiful movie moments. I dare you to beat me at ping pong and would love to throw a frisbee.

Words my friends use to describe me: genuine, friendly, introspective, self-improving, spontaneous, quirky.

I have a diverse professional background including [ReadMe](https://andytrattner.com/March-2020.html), [Scale AI](https://andytrattner.com/Scale-AI.html), [Lean On Me](https://lean0n.me/), [the White House](https://blog.ed.gov/2017/07/the-ability-to-inspire/), and [the Space Station](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160001341). I tend to move fast, for example earning [my degree in math + CS from MIT](/img/mit-diploma.png) (Course 18c) in 3 years versus the standard 4 years.

Engage me with your questions and feedback! Let's reconnect after years of radio silence! When in doubt, [reach out](https://forms.gle/kwANcR9NaYDAHDD16){:target="_blank"}. Snail mail and ringing phones are comforting in my old age.

If you happen to have my number, call anytime&mdash;I love phone tag (and friendship is timeless). There's really no need to text and ask if I'm available. In fact, I might not answer since I don't like texting or notifications in general.
