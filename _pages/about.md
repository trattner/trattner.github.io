I currently work at [Scale AI](https://scale.com/){:target="_blank"} in San Francisco on the Customer Operations team. I'm trying my best to follow through on some [2020 resolutions](https://andytrattner.com/decade-reflections-2020.html)!

Previously, I taught [chess in St. Louis](https://saintlouischessclub.org/){:target="_blank"}, [ran the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program for the White House](https://blog.ed.gov/2017/07/the-ability-to-inspire/){:target="_blank"} under Presidents Obama and Trump, interned at an [early-stage Boston-based VC firm](https://www.pillar.vc/), cofounded the mental health nonprofit [Lean On Me](https://lean0n.me/){:target="_blank"}, conducted structural analysis at Northrop Grumman on the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope){:target="_blank"}, made [remote-controlled bubbles on the Space Station](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160001341.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and obtained a [B.S. in Mathematics with Computer Science](/img/mit-diploma.png){:target="_blank"} from MIT in three years.

This site started as a blog inspired by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2019/06/writing-not-plastics-not-wall-street/){:target="_blank"}. I've been calling it "ALT Thoughts" (my initials). After writing an average of 11 posts per month for 11 months in 2019&mdash;mostly regurgitating Seth&mdash;I decided it was time to choose: go all-in and blog my heart out, or publish more personal updates per subscriber requests. The latter has the upper hand for now...monthly personal updates are a go. You can click "random" below to get a sample of previous work, or visit the "archive". Some favorites:
