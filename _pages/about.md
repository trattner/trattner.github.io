I'm an [Engineer](https://overcast.fm/+L0YXHOgJQ){:target="_blank"}, with the [heart](https://seths.blog/2017/05/emotional-labor/){:target="_blank"} of an [Educator](https://seths.blog/2016/11/education-is-the-answer/){:target="_blank"} and the [spirit](https://seths.blog/2014/08/turning-passion-on-its-head/){:target="_blank"} of an [Entrepreneur](https://seths.blog/2018/04/entrepreneurship-is-not-a-job/){:target="_blank"}.

My mission is to accelerate human intelligence by empowering people. I'm optimistic about our collective potential.

I cherish my background and relationships, which enable me to pursue this end uniquely well.
