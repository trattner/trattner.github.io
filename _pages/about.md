I'm currently traveling and writing! As always, [enjoying food](https://github.com/trattner/atratt/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-31-food.md) and tempted to [play poker against my best interests](https://github.com/trattner/atratt/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-25-poker-sim.md).

My professional background includes [ReadMe](https://andytrattner.com/March-2020.html), [Scale AI](https://andytrattner.com/Scale-AI.html), [Lean On Me](https://lean0n.me/), [the White House](https://blog.ed.gov/2017/07/the-ability-to-inspire/), [MIT](/img/mit-diploma.png), and [the Space Station](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20160001341). I've previously posted some links to [what the Internet has said about me](https://andytrattner.com/February-2020.html#on-social-media-and-google).

I enjoy [cooking](https://github.com/trattner/atratt/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-31-food.md) and I always do the dishes. Once upon a time, [I made a fancy battlebot](https://github.com/trattner/atratt/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-31-battlebot.md). I'm often tempted to play poker [against my best interests](https://github.com/trattner/atratt/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-25-poker-sim.md). I am affectionate towards animals but don't like having pets. I cry during beautiful movie moments. I dare you to beat me at ping pong and would love to throw a frisbee.

Words my friends use to describe me: genuine, friendly, introspective, self-improving, spontaneous, quirky.
