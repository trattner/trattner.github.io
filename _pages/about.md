this page is ***UNDER CONSTRUCTION*** but here's an outline

## Autobiography

## Perspectives

How do you view me? Would love a sentence from you. Submit [HERE](https://goo.gl/forms/abIg3qNtGQrvOMPu1)!

## Principles

something including language as a core technology of the human OS.

## Activities

## Family

What is family? The dictionary definition has to do with descendants of common ancestors. Math and science like to use it as an abbreviation for "group of objects with some threshold closeness relation." In terms of social utility, family ideally involves persistence of goodwill through spacetime. This is an incomplete list and ever-growing list of the folks to whom I dedicate sizable slices of my infinite (Platonic) love. From the bottom of my heart, to the top of my noggin, and back down again to my feet, thank you for everything.

- Wendy

## Muses

Key inspiration sources including heroines and heroes, quotes that animate my life, and books that have shaped my mental model of the world.

## Talk

contact mechanisms

## External

Acknowledging what other folks publish, independently or with my input.
