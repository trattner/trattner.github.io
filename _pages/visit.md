Soon I'll have [a place of my own](/construction-strugs){:target='_self'} to officially host visitors. Until then, I highly recommend [Maya's mountain sanctuary](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4141863) in Vilcabamba 45 minutes south:

I came to Ecuador for a [spontaneous vacation in November 2020](/ecuador){:target='_self'}. After a couple weeks with Maya, I ended up [loving it so much](/love-ecuador){:target='_self'} that I decided to stay.

I'm currently residing in [Loja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loja,_Ecuador) (pronounced low-ha), a small city nestled in the Andes mountains over a mile above sea level. Loja has a couple universities, a mild climate, Ecuador's first wind farm, safe friendly neighborhoods, a few restaurants with international cuisines, and some pleasant nature trails.

My apartment is in a modern building with the picturesque view above, and hotels are around $20 per night. Large delicious meals including a drink can be found for less than $2.50. Love that _guata_ and _morocho_ combo from the market!

It's a great place to visit and experience local life + flavors. You might learn, as I did, how to [move bricks](/moving-bricks){:target='_self'} and [shower slowly](/showering-slowly){:target='_self'}.

Tourist trips I'd like to try someday with friends include: the Galapagos, Quito, the Amazon, the coast, and other South American countries.

Happy to answer questions about visiting Ecuador and staying with myself or Maya!
