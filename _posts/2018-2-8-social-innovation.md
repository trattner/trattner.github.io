title: 'Success? Easy!? (On Social Innovation)'
date: 2018-2-8

I would like to jot down some of my thoughts for an upcoming talk on social innovation, as part of MIT's inaugural Innovation Week in February 2018. I was prompted to do two things. The first is to broaden students' views on innovation as not merely a technological phenomenon (common MIT misconception). The second is to empower students to innovate. The idea: Lean On Me as a student-led initiative perhaps shows how tons of experience is not required to make substantial impact.

### Introduction

I want to center the talk on a quote, "Success? Easy! Double your rate of failure." This is attributed to IBM's Thomas Watson, though I am still unclear as to its origin, so we will assume it's from Watson Sr. The PKG Center cautioned that such a quote is highly context-dependent. If you are working in a precarious situation, with mental health or underserved communities, perhaps failure is not something to aim for and celebrate. Such nuances are easy to understand once we analyze the quote, so let's ignore this for now and come back at the end to see if we have made progress.

On a very basic level, the quote succinctly conveys the engineer's mindset. You want to test your product or design with the most challenging test cases possible, so that in the real world you have already anticipated and overcome failure modes with a robust approach you can be confident in. If you do not thoroughly explore failure, you will likely lack an adequate definition of success. The upside is that we shed some of the pressure of success by allowing ourselves to make short-term mistakes in favor of long-term gains, and we are empowered to immediately take action in some direction, which we can iteratively course-correct if that direction is misguided.

To explore this central idea further, I proceed in three steps. The first is to broaden our perspective on innovation and technology, explaining an interesting new mindset that I have only recently begun to explore. The second is to look at the example of Lean On Me in the context of this new perspective. The third is to wrap our heads around some of the most challenging parts of innovation and learn how to overcome them. We conclude with a brief summary.

### The Many Forms of Innovation

What is your favorite technology? Wikipedia says, "Technology is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives." Perhaps you like television, cars, glasses, pencils, the internet, airplanes, farming, or cellphones. For me, it's language.

Consider a robot which helps you build a house or maybe vacuums your floor. The robot is augmenting your productive capacity by working on something you will to occur. You get the robot to do this (or somebody else does) by programming it. Naturally, because software is such a scalable and diverse tool, many students study computer science to practice software engineering.

Now, consider a general, unspecified task which you find important for society. How can you go about multiplying your productive capacity to achieve your will of a favorable outcome? Without strong AI, perhaps the most effective thing you can do to leverage your impact is get other people to team up with you. And you do that by communicating with them, by coordinating and aligning yourselves not with code, but with English.

Language is technology. MIT saved the best for last in Course 24. Regardless of our discipline, we all have to take humanities subjects. And while this is often thought of as a soft skill, we can actually study concrete strategies and techniques to improve our skills rigorously. If computer programming is an art as well as a science, then so too must be communication.

Jorge Luis Borges describes an infinite library filled with books containing random characters in "The Library of Babel." Given such a setting, the narrator claims, "To speak is to incur tautologies." Because some series of books contains your full life story already written, the meaning of it all is called into question. My answer is that the words on the page lack intentionality. Even though they are written in a book, acting and experiencing them gives an additional dimension to that universe, a dimension which only you can instantiate.

The takeaway here is that we can be innovative in ways other than building with bricks. We can build with words, we can build with ideas, we can build with people. Organizations are composed of people, and we can only streamline and optimize the information flows among brains if we understand the underlying protocols of language.

It is an efficient way to understand conscious entities like humans...this talk is about me trying to download information directly into your brain and the only way we can all do that in a common way is through language. To make social innovation, to tackle systematic issues in society, necessitates an understanding and appreciation of this basic language infrastructure and communication protocol.

Keep this perspective in mind, to question and broaden your definition of technology and innovation.

### Lean On Me: Lessons Learned

I emailed a bunch of mental health people around campus saying that we should have a student counseling service where people could talk with one another somehow. Nobody wanted to do it, and many people thought various services already existed to this end. Frustrated, and not really wanting to spend much time on this thing which should have already existed, I found a team to spend a few hours at a hackathon seeing what we could come up with.

We started with a landing page, an SMS engine built on Twilio, a very basic process to match users and supporters, and an identity-shielding procedure which eventually included encryption to preserve user and supporter anonymity. With urging from MIT's legal folks, we threw together some training resources, and to launch the service we did a tiny bit of advertising around campus.

Which part of Lean On Me do you think is the most important innovation?

I learned a lot in creating Lean On Me. For one, I discovered that I could not code. I also found that I really enjoyed talking to people and working with various stakeholders to formulate a team vision. But the thing that changed my life was working on the training program. I learned how much it matters when you really, truly listen to another human being. How much it can mean to empathize and engage with them. I learned some very basic skills which I didn't know were skills, and they immediately changed my life.

Three friends that I lived with, went to high school with, or otherwise saw regularly around campus told me that they struggled with depression. I was shocked, and thankfully, I knew how to handle the hours-long conversations we had about that difficult subject. I found my personal relationships improving and growing in amazing ways, due to a few simple changes in how I interacted with others. I matured enormously through these life skills I gained.

The Lean On Me training is, in my opinion, the core innovation of the service. The service is built on student volunteers, who ingest over 80 hours of drug and substance abuse, depression and suicide, conflict management, and relationships and sexual violence training, all compressed into under three hours. The skills that folks gain can be used on the hotline, in their residential communities, and throughout the rest of their lives. The training that we initially thought of as a small necessary legality, has come to be seen as a transformative, life-changing experience. And implanting that positive seed in individuals through language allows entire communities to be uplifted.

Our streamlined training pipeline takes the key pieces from days-long trainings which students normally don't have time for, and we distill concrete conversational micro-skills and important contextual education about when and how to use the training we practice in our workshop. Just a couple weeks ago, I heard Professor Woodie Flowers speak on education versus training. He said, "calculus is training" and "learning when to use calculus is education." We integrate both components in our supporter development process.

The Wright Brothers published a newspaper which contained the quote, "If a boy finds he can make a few articles with his hands, it tends to make him rely on himself. And the planning that is necessary for the execution of the work is a discipline and an education of great value to him." This echoes the Woodie Flowers model of education and training, which Lean On Me has stumbled not-so-deliberately on to. I like to think of innovation as actualizing potential, or helping achieve something that was not quite within reach before.

The takeaway here is that by starting with ourselves and shaping our language, we can one by one by ten begin to change society. And it took a couple of years to really get enough steam collected to make headway, but that is natural since any problem exists since there is some stationary, inertial force maintaining it.

### Getting Stuck and Getting Started

I think the hardest part of innovation, or doing anything really, is getting started. In _Zero to One_, Thiel and Masters write, "Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1." To go from nothing to something is very, very difficult. But it turns out that it doesn't have to be.

One way to think of going from zero to 1 is having a will to do something but no progress or direction to show for it. Then we take some action, perhaps over the course of many years, and eventually we have some solution and we arrive at our goal. In the case of Lean On Me, I started with no will at all to tackle the issue, just an email to other people on campus, then we took some grudging baby steps at a hackathon and beyond to recruit a team and start the service, and now we have a national nonprofit with half a dozen campuses helping hundreds of students, all earning solid user ratings. But who knew we would end up here, and how much enormous effort did it take?

Another way to think of going from 0 to 100% completion is that we start out with a bunch of assets already in place, a lot of potential---for instance, friends who have extra time to work on side projects, students who wear TMAYD bracelets to support the community, and a ton of supportive MIT programs with capital attracting skilled students. Then we take these assets and coordinate them, communicating with various parties to work towards some ideal which we cannot actually reach, but we can define in terms of what success looks like and what failure looks like.

In this second way, we no longer view the process as so difficult. We are not picking up and suddenly running a marathon. We are recognizing that we have been on jogs before, that we have set up a bunch of water and rest stations, and now we need to just walk 10 feet to the starting line, then jog a half mile to warm up, then do another mile to set the pace, and another mile until the first water station, and so on, taking challenges in bite-sized chunks but always building on what was previously there. To make social innovation, just like good math, we need only do a little innovation, and most of that is formulating and framing and understanding the problem thoroughly in order to pull together the right pieces to fit a solution and iteratively improve it.

Marvin Minsky said, "One can acquire certainty only by amputating inquiry." I can explain this quote by using the idea of the creative-analytical spectrum. On one side, we have brainstorming, bold courage, love, action, altruism but perhaps not effective altruism. On the other is observation, stress-testing a single idea for flaws, competition, wariness, caution, and a desire for the best and only the best solution. Minsky's quote, then, is about deciding when to come up creatively with the right questions, and when to act decisively using the incomplete information that the universe has allowed us to collect about those questions.

The takeaway here is to try to define success in measurable chunks so you can work your way towards bite-sized milestones instead of tackling the entire 0 to 1 journey all at once. To start, you can recognize that you actually are not starting at zero but you are starting with some assets. To make social innovation, the whole society part is already built for you! Now you just have to think through what your version of success looks like, and in so doing you must explicate what your feared failure actually looks like.

With Lean On Me, to write our legal policies, there were a few very specific scenarios that we wanted to counter. For example, not to get sued and not to have users committing suicide due to things our student volunteers said. With such clear negative outcomes defined, it becomes easier to work towards favorable outcomes by preventative measures, though we honestly still struggle with these questions and are continuously needing to revise our policies and practices to better our services.

### Conclusion

I have tried to explain how I think about language as a technology, Lean On Me as using language to implement innovation on an individual level to ultimately change communities and society, and the breakdown of the zero to one analogy on how to run a marathon in little bits.

These represent an incomplete list of some interesting thoughts that I hope will empower folks to find social innovation more approachable. Work on what you know in order to help you start exploring what you don't know. Take action in some way to build experiences that will ultimately lead to success.

I got burnt out after less than a year of working on Lean On Me, and I believe that I failed as a leader to help Lean On Me scale. Only after I stepped down and others, currently my freshman year roommate, could take more ownership over the organization, did expansion occur. This allowed me to reflect on my experience and develop cohesive thoughts and narratives to help me live a more effective life.

So if you can take away one thing from this talk, I hope that you will take away the idea of "Success? Easy! Double your rate of failure." Experience is not required to innovate, you are already in a great spot if you care enough to listen to this talk, and you surely have lots of assets to draw upon. Think about small baby steps you can take to get started, and how you might explore your definitions of success and failure in your problem domain of interest. Once you settle on one idea, broaden your mindset to see if there are other surprising ways to think about things, like language as a technology.

And remember, while experience is not required to innovate, only by experience can you gain the insights of failure on the road to success. So get started now!
