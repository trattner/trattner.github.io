I'm writing a book on teaching chess to beginners, and I need some help before publishing.

If you know any parents of kids age 4-14, the younger the better, I'd love to get their feedback.

Here is a [link to the first draft](/chess/How_To_Teach_Your_Child_Chess.pdf). It's short and sweet, only 50 small pages with diagrams and a big font. It can be read in under an hour.

And here is a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwUXcVbPMw8a5-FMUedXXym0W1qIxC-3UvbdJp_KQ87A7V3w/viewform?usp=sf_link) for anyone who wants to help (non-parents welcome). Best is if we can walk through the questions live over a half hour Zoom or phone call: [link to schedule a chat](https://calendly.com/how-to-chess/meet).

After my post on [Learning Chess The Easy Way](https://andytrattner.com/chess-the-easy-way.html) got a decent response this past summer, I'm more excited than ever to spread these ideas to folks who might find them useful.

Go ahead and share the PDF far and wide! Thanks for your interest and help. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
