title: Heading To Ecuador

I'm flying today from Philadelphia to Ecuador! Returning February 12, 2021.

The main thrust of the trip is a [retreat to the mountains](https://enchantingwind.com/), which will take place from the end of November through mid-January (six weeks and change). I'm very much looking forward to this grand reset to close out a crazy 2020.

The journey starts from Guayaquil to Vilcabamba, a week of leisurely southward busing via Machala and Loja. Then after the retreat (an as yet unplanned period), I'll roughly head north to Quito, where my sister will join me for the final week.

I'd like to get more into the details of why I'm traveling during COVID, perhaps another time. For now, I'll just say that I'm very grateful for this opportunity. Hope all is well stateside. Looking forward to reconnecting in Feb.
