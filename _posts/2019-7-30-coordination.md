Money is a tool to coordinate people around ideas.

The idea that you'd like to eat a hamburger. The idea that we'd like to go to Mars. The idea that a luxurious weekend vacation with some interesting people could lead to mutually (and perhaps socially) beneficial things.  

You can't simply throw money at problems to solve them. People need to put in effort to make things happen.

And usually, money doesn't work the way it's supposed to. It's not deployed efficiently or allocated fairly.

But sometimes, money is useful.

It reflects our will and creativity and values. It amplifies our direction, individually and collectively.

It draws people places, to do things and say things and dance to the tune of collaboration, service.

Let's use it well.
