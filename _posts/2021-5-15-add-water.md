title: Just Add Water

Today I cooked rice for dinner. It's one of the easiest things to make.

Yet somehow I always manage to create an irredeemably goopy soup.

Instead of trying to start with the right amount of water, this time I dramatically underestimated. When it got low, I added a splash more until the grains softened.

With a little conscious effort, I dialed down my default settings and made the perfect pot.

Sometimes the right amount is ridiculously small, with room to grow.
