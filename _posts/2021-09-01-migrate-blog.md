date: 2021-9-1

This will be my last blog post on AndyTrattner.com because I'd like to point you to my [new blog HERE](https://world.hey.com/tratt/)!

All y'all current subscribers should receive an email to make things official. Please go re-subscribe; this time it's not a google form.  

Sorry I broke my new year's resolution to publish a post every Friday. It's time to change things up.

The first official post is live over there already: [_Funemployed_](https://world.hey.com/tratt/funemployed-2bb8db34).

As I [mentioned back in February](/hey), Hey is amazing.
