Instead of buying a hamburger, I could go and make one. I might need some cooking instruments. Maybe a crash course in ground beef. I'll need some condiment planning. Pickle, tomato, onion, lettuce, bun.

I might have to decide on my ideal meat consumption levels, perhaps seeking ethical alternatives. Maybe I should redecorate my eating space a bit.

If there's an existing habit of hamburger-buying, then that familiar path is attractive. These other things sound like a lot of work. Planning, prep, cooking, plating, cleanup. And throughout the process, I'm fully responsible for issues that arise.

No wonder we pay for the cooked burger. We pay for the privilege of "Not my fault." We pay to scour the menu instead of creating one from scratch. We pay to claim choice over our time.
