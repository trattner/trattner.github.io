A year ago, Seth Godin tried to [fix the Gmail promo folder](https://seths.blog/2020/01/fixing-your-email-promo-folder/). As the inventor of [Permission Marketing](https://permission.com), he has [a lot of great thoughts on email](https://seths.blog/?s=email).

They boil down to exactly that&mdash;permission.

Why do we use email? It's a tool to communicate with folks we want to talk to. For example, blog subscribers have told me, "please send me your weekly email." This is a mutually beneficial relationship built on sharing, a net positive information exchange.

There's a lot of trust in giving someone unlimited access to your phone number and house address.

When I create an account with the New York Times, my bank, Slack, or whatever website, I vaguely tolerate the first unsolicited "Welcome To Our Service" guide. But I truly abhor the subsequent three reminders to please finish setting up my account and oh, we think you'll like this other thing too.

Such spam abuses my trust. Why carpet bomb all your customers, sacrificing their valuable time and energy, to incrementally boost retention and usage stats? This intentional disregard for human life might even be worse than the impersonal catalogs and grocery coupons in the mailbox.

My [life logistics project](/value-expression){:target="_self"} this week steps towards more thoughtful communication in downgrading to a new Ecuadorian cell phone and upgrading to a new email with [HEY](https://hey.com/).

It happens to be cost-effective, reducing my $30-70 Google Fi bill to under $15 per month. This will quickly pay for the cheap new device and my $99/yr subscription to [consensual communication](https://hey.com/the-hey-way/#consent).

More importantly, I'm satisfying aesthetic and moral preferences as one of those weirdos who cares about [kerning](https://play.acast.com/s/akimbo/sittinginjudgment) and cannot passively wait for [better macro structures](https://play.acast.com/s/akimbo/payingforstamps) to eventually bend the culture.

It's a pleasure to deliver this week's blog post to subscribers using my favorite new digital tool.
