An investor says "I'm excited about this idea." She puts cash on the table. She watches for gains and losses. Thrilling.

An entrepreneur (artist) says "I'm excited about this work." She shows up to the table and grinds&mdash;for hours...days...years. She eventually compresses the nitty gritty pieces into a passion snowball. Exhausting.

A dreamer says "I'm excited about this outcome." He contemplates the ideal table, whispers an incantation, wills potential into motion. He sees change even when nothing happens. Easy.

You can be one or more.

But there are no other categories.
