In _[Give and Take](https://smile.amazon.com/Give-Take-Helping-Others-Success/dp/0143124986/){:target="_blank"}_, Adam Grant discusses how super-givers have superpowers.

These people not only give the most, they also receive the most&mdash;in the long run. This virtuous cycle allows them to give even more.

Super-givers do better than matchers and better than takers. They also do far better than pooper-givers, folks on the other end of the spectrum who selflessly grind themselves to nothingness without the right balance of self-care and self-returns.

The book is a great starting point; like many books, it's very interesting and nice to read. But like many books, its essential teaching is easily forgotten, passed by unabsorbed.

It's impossible to infinitely maintain any initiative with negative ROI, unless the costs are somehow subsidized.

We must structure our time and efforts to combine altruism and self-interest in a positive flywheel.
