title: Showering Slowly

I just discovered the secret of hot showers in Ecuador.

If you turn the faucet on all the way, the water never gets past lukewarm.

But if you turn it half way, then the water has time to boil a little in the shower head, where electricity does its magic.

Probably the most difficult part isn't discovering how the system works.

It's about adjusting expectations.

Not going 105% to the right until there isn't any more room to navigate and the water doesn't have time to flow.
