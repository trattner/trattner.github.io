title: Showering Slowly

Ecuadorian plumbing usually only permits one degree of freedom to the user: do you want your water fast or slow?

The left handle doesn't work. It's not hooked up to anything. The right one completely drives the flow, and there's zero temperature control.

For weeks, this presented a challenge. Was I doomed to taking lukewarm showers?

The breaking point came last week. If needed, I would rip apart the wall and re-wire the house. I had to find out why these fat electric shower heads don't do their job.

Initially, I blamed the brand and the culture. People must be buying cheap stuff to take the edge off the cold, rather than investing in a serious heating spec.

But then maybe I didn't understand the little settings toggle on the side of the shower head. Or did the light switch need to be on or off to permit electricity to do its magic up there?

The last thing I tried was to assume everything worked fine and adjust the one thing under my control within the given constraints: to turn the shower faucet only half way.

Instead of jetting out with sad unfulfilled memories of electric heat, now the water could spend a little more time cozying up in there before meeting the air. Less pressure, more heat.

Plenty of heat, wow, this is a hot shower!

I guess the hard part wasn't discovering how the system works. There were only so many things to try, so trying them all would of course yield a conclusive result.

But a lot of time and stress could have been saved if I had first looked to adjust my muscle memory and expectations.

The problem wasn't the shower head. It was my default American programming to turn the nob 105% to the right.

<!-- I just discovered the secret of hot showers in Ecuador.

If you turn the faucet on all the way, the water never gets past lukewarm.

But if you turn it half way, then the water has time to boil a little in the shower head, where electricity does its magic.

Probably the most difficult part isn’t discovering how the system works.

It’s about adjusting expectations.

Not going 105% to the right until there isn’t any more room to navigate and the water doesn’t have time to flow.
