I would not have guessed a stranger could influence me to drive six hours and spend over $100 on chocolate. But that's exactly what happened.

It's odd, how close this comes to religion. The daily pilgrimages for the sake of His ideas. But I can't help it. He's transformed how I see and how I live.

So here are a few breadcrumbs for the uninitiated. Start wherever and enjoy!

[Here](https://seths.blog/2011/09/talkers-block/){:target="_blank"} [are](https://seths.blog/2011/05/the-future-of-the-library/){:target="_blank"} [a](https://seths.blog/2011/05/hard-work-vs-long-work/){:target="_blank"} [few](https://seths.blog/2016/12/the-best-way-to-stand-for-something/){:target="_blank"} [that](https://seths.blog/2017/05/choosing-your-fuel/){:target="_blank"} [I](https://seths.blog/2011/05/whats-high-school-for/){:target="_blank"} [enjoyed](https://seths.blog/2014/03/not-even-one-note/){:target="_blank"}.

- **[Akimbo Podcast](http://hear.sethpodcast.com/){:target="_blank"}.** Seth narrates the equivalent of 4-5 blog posts strung together, creating extra depth and impact. You can hear me asking a couple questions in the Moore's Law and Money Moves episodes.

- **[Books](https://smile.amazon.com/Seth-Godin/e/B000AP9EH0/){:target="_blank"}.** [The Dip](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666/){:target="_blank"} taught me when to quit. [Linchpin](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1591844096/){:target="_blank"} taught me I'm an artist. [Permission Marketing](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0684856360/){:target="_blank"} taught me how to date. I'm excited to read [This Is Marketing](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0525540830/){:target="_blank"}...I suspect this is Seth's crowning achievement, where he manages to best cram his entire worldview into a single package.
