The short version: I love empanadas. Really. It's a primal thing&mdash;instinctive, carnal. Lust from the bones. Tattoo on the heart. Maybe my soul is shaped like an empanada. I have imprinted on them. Ball is life? Empanada is life.

The long version: along with Barcelona's Parc G&uuml;ell hilltop, the chess club near Pla&ccedil;a de Catalunya, work in El Poblenou, and ping pong in the Parc de la Ciutadella, I frequented an Argentinian empanada chain called La F&aacute;brica.

Glass front like an Apple Store, display cases like an ice cream shop. A veritable 31 flavors of chicken, chorizo, steak, mushroom, cheese, tuna, vegan, gluten free, you name it. Baby blue walls, wood counters and chairs, stainless steel appliances. Choose 1, 2, or 3 of those shiny, delightful pouches. Mix and match, make it a meal with a cold drink from a can. Watch the short, sweet, sweltering parade process down conveyor-belt lane to the takeaway bags. Walk away with your mouth around a thin, firm crust yielding to blissful warm tender goodness.

Stateside, I became obsessed. Nothing compares. It blows the Chipotle burrito experience out of the water. Learned the [recipe](https://www.laylita.com/recipes/empanadas-mendocinas/){:target="_blank"}, spoke with a couple restaurant founders, found an available domain. "Life should be simple and delicious as eating an empanada." Jobs and a community for those in need, healthy branding, automation potential!

A colleague asked if it's empanada or empa&ntilde;ada, and Google taught us about [hyperforeignism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperforeignism){:target="_blank"}. My evangelism ground to a halt. I'd never heard the word before. Me, sesquipedalian me! And what joy, a new word! But perhaps these things don't matter very much. It's about the product, the taste. Right?

Kneading dough for hours is a great way to ponder the paradoxical challenges of bringing empanadas to the people. Chimichurri or Sriracha mayo, it turns out everyone wants a distinctive blend of _picante_ and _suave_ in their life sauce. Good things in small packages can stay that way. Personal joy need not be shared at scale.

What do you want others to consume?
