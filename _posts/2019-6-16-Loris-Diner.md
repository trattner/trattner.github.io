There's a diner down the street from my apartment. It looks old-school, retro. I ordered a delicious malted milkshake the first time I visited. And the second. Amazing!

The quality of the milkshake varied widely on the third and fourth visits. I realized the diner was not responsible for the generous malt&mdash;it was various individual employees.

The fifth visit, they forgot the malt and failed to fix it when asked. I'm not going back because I no longer support the management of this establishment.
