With an interesting date match on [Voicebar](https://voicebar.co) and the rainy season [pausing my construction project](/construction-strugs), I spontaneously visited San Francisco this month from April 3rd to the 21st.

Two and half weeks wasn't nearly enough time to spend with my sister...let alone other friends. Some got very short blocks, and some were completely left out of the visit (sorry!).

I don't yet have a plan to move back to the States, but I'm considering it much more heavily than before the trip. If I could magically snap my fingers and improve one relationship, I'd want to grow my bond with Wendy.

Being physically close reminded me how connections deepen through meaningful joint experiences. Even with a sibling whom I've known for decades, we still have so much more room to develop together. The marginal benefit of each shared moment is not going down.

A lot can happen virtually, but I doubt there will be a substitute for in-person interaction for at least the next decade or two.

I'm also re-evaluating my relationship to the working world after 7 months of funemployment.

I'd like to re-establish a steady income stream before the year ends to maintain my choice lifestyle, to enable more flexibility, and to take responsibility for potentially starting a family someday. [Getting a decent job](https://andytrattner.com/career-misconceptions) is the easiest way to achieve this outcome.

However, I made the decision six years ago to eschew career ladders when I declined a dream internship offer at SpaceX. I chose to build out [Lean On Me](https://lean0n.me) instead, and ever since I have sought an engaging day-to-day existence over [status and financial reward](/losing-1m).

You could view [my path](https://andytrattner.com/you-part-2) as low-EV and impulsive. But I'd argue there can never be enough risky adventure for someone like me who's aggressively pursuing self-actualization. I'm glad to have iterated towards this blog and a couple other projects worth doubling down on as the journey continues.

In the months to come, I'll be a bit more mindful balancing financial responsibility against my current primary challenge: to engage more fully on a daily basis in developing a creative [Practice](https://seths.blog/trust-yourself/) and [Turning Pro](https://stevenpressfield.com/books/turning-pro/).

_Getting more in touch with my body is essential to this process._

I would not have written that sentence before the SF trip; the outcome of my date and insights from my therapist have given me some interesting new perspectives. I'm beginning to see how the planning intellectual part of me dominates counterproductively across myriad situations. Like all [Martians](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0060574216/), it seems I need to get more in touch with my feelings.

People often think I have high EQ as a super friendly dude. For example, I had a great first day in Quito meeting some folks who work at the [Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas%C3%ADlica_del_Voto_Nacional). We ended up going for drinks and spent more than four hours hanging out!

I then returned the following day (yesterday), accepting the store owner's chess challenge and hospitality: beer + _colada morada_ + great views.

However, I have a lot of weird blocks when it comes to romance, and I'm far less experienced at it than friendship, acquaintance-making, or chess... For the longest time, I didn't date at all because I thought a life partner would be a zero-sum competitor against other non-romantic goals.

After graduating college, [_The Defining Decade_](https://smile.amazon.com/Defining-Decade-Your-Twenties-Matter/dp/0446561754/) finally showed me how I was wrong, and that the right partner would actually be a positive-sum contributor to my life. But it wasn't until last summer that I was finally ready to start dating properly.

I acquired non-gym clothes and grooming habits. I got on the apps. I read up on how to avoid being a tactless buffoon. I then face-palmed thinking about many regretful past interactions in which I behaved much worse than a tactless buffoon.

This month's trip hit home how I need to revise my internal language around romance. "Dating and finding a life partner" is logistically but not emotionally accurate. I can't have an intellectual framework motivating me because falling in love is not a to-do list project.

It sounds so obvious to write that, but it's also super motivating and empowering. I've put in a lot of work trying and failing to do right in my relationships, career, passion projects, and love life. I'm excited to bring more intentionality and feeling to it all going forward.
