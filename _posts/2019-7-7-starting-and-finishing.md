It's a good idea to finish what we start. The discipline of commitment and follow-through separates adults from children.  

Finishing is hard. Often, starting is hard too.

The only way to get things done (or started) is to prioritize them. To focus on them. To spend time and exert effort. To take responsibility.

The Wright Brothers required less than a decade to create the airplane. But it probably still felt like a long time.

If we're spending all of our willpower and attention on dotting the "i"s and crossing the "t"s, we're never going to write the next sentence.

But if we don't have the bandwidth to make our handwriting legible and concise, then it's not going to be worth much to anyone.

Do what matters, and do it well.
