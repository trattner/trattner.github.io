Death comes closer, ever closer&mdash;
Creeping, seeping, leaping near&mdash;
To take back, gently, what was given
And in so doing, soothe all fears.

Worry not? _Blaspheme! Treason!_
Accepting such abandons reason!
She who welcomes her last breath
Shall find it in the very next!

Ah, but friend, you misunderstand&mdash;
I preach not action nor attitude&mdash;
Nay, I implore but recognition:
In facing facts, find fortitude.

Stoically, I must agree.
Of course the facts ring true to me.
All the same, I'd rather hang
Than prematurely resign the game.

I see, OK, fight on today&mdash;
Your spirit shines admirable and fine&mdash;
Tomorrow, however, I shall return
And convince you that it's time.
