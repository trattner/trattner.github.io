title: 'Math and Engineering at MIT Taught Me To Beat Writer&#39;s Block'

We have all been there: waking up early, prepping the work station, deciding that yes&mdash;today will be the day! But when push comes to shove...we decide it's actually time for a snack, for a cup of tea, to watch another Youtube video on how it's supposed to be done, to check on email or Facebook or the dog. Getting started can be challenging. I did not have a solid understanding of how to do it effectively until age 21, midway through my senior year of college, when the solution to writer's block finally dawned on me.

What is writer's block? I remember in elementary school, "writer's block" was the same as "being stuck." Teachers and students would talk in terms of individual assignments. Wikipedia calls this "blank page syndrome," reserving writer's block for the more serious condition of losing creative ability over a long time period. For our purposes, let's forget about the semantics and understand writer's block more generally, as a placeholder for difficulty making progress in any domain: painting, cooking, engineering, or mathematics.

To explain the solution, I would like to tell you about my high school chess coach, a special education teacher who would stay late Tuesdays and Thurdays teaching us the game. He was emphatic about taking tournaments one game at a time. "Don't worry about the score at the end of the day," he would urge, "worry about your next move." With his coaching, we always exceeded our expectations, but I never thought too deeply about his advice until now. It turns out his mental conditioning translates nicely across many domains. For example, it is a best practice in software engineering to write modular code&mdash;breaking down big-picture goals into subproblems. In math, we might be given a complicated, scary function, and the first step to proving global behavior is to look for properties at the micro-scale which can then be used to make progress.

Is it easier to run a marathon or walk ten feet? Unless we run regularly, it might seem to us that marathon runners are somehow superhuman. But that's because we are not looking at the world the same way that they are. I have never run a marathon, but I'm assuming that it's similar to winning a chess tournament: you just focus on your next move. First, you walk ten feet to the starting point. Then you run half a mile and pat yourself on the back for warming up. Then you focus on the next mile and a half to settle into your pace. With each new mile, you take things step by step, water break to water break. Maybe the dauntingly large map of the overall course enters your thoughts, but you don't fixate on that because you are focused on achieving your short-term goal.

Now, let's talk about writing. I have been wanting to make a personal website blog thing for the past four years, but I never made much progress. Now, after just a few hours, it's done! And I'm confident that I can write a new post weekly. What changed?

I now think of my work like a progress bar as opposed to a binary status. Before, I used to think of things in two categories: completed product or pile of garbage. But now I see that everything exists on a spectrum.
- First, I have the intention to write.
- Then, I have a few topics on my mind which I can jot down as the start of a brainstorming list.
- Next, I choose a topic, always knowing that I can go back and try another one.
- I get started outlining potential key points.
- To flush out the outline, I close my eyes, speak, and get a draft on the page.
- I edit the words I wrote, changing the order of paragraphs, elaborating here or excising there.
- Revising this first pass makes a decent second draft, and I'm nearly finished.
At every point along the way, I only had to worry about small, accomplishable tasks.

I believe that writer's block is related to our expectations. Consider the following: expecting ourselves to cook using a ridiculously fancy recipe and get it perfectly right on the first try, expecting ourselves to write a best-selling world-changing book, or expecting ourselves to graduate college having had THE MOST FUN while also being THE MOST PREPARED to make THE MOST MONEY or THE MOST IMPACT. With such expectations, aren't we much more likely to feel stuck, stupid, and powerless than smart, effective, and achieving? Because we expect great things, we don't see progress coming in less-than-great, bite-sized chunks...getting started is akin to finishing, and that takes a lot of work, so we procrastinate. We will more easily distract ourselves with vaguely related tasks, such as cleaning our desk, writing an "about the author" section, or telling folks on Facebook our latest resolutions.

One of the coolest applications of this writer's block analogy is making life decisions, as in the previous example of choosing a college major. To make the decision, we have to find reasons which convince us that one path is better than the rest. Usually, those reasons fall into general categories. In the degree example, perhaps the categories are difficulty, earning potential, program reputation, likelihood to make friends in the major, and general enjoyment of the subject matter. The problem is that we often don't know exactly how much we care about each category. We might be uncertain, scared we will miss out, or that we will make the wrong choice due to something we haven't yet considered. And we are often swayed by what we think others will think of us. So how should we go about making progress on these choices, then?

The first step is to recognize that we haven't yet decided. Throughout my four years wanting to make this blog, I kept beating myself up for never actually doing it. But that wasn't very healthy or helpful. It is much better to make peace with the fact that we aren't yet ready, and that's an OK place to be. We are at one of the steps (intention to write, brainstorming, etc) and we aren't quite ready to move on, but at least we have identified that we have a goal.

The second step is to simply be patient with ourselves. It takes time to do important things, and the larger the expectation, the more time it will take. It may even take a few years for us to fully articulate where we stand in terms of which decision categories matter to us. In the meantime, we can try sampling various experiences to get a flavor of each of them, or we can find others who already have the experiences and ask them for advice. We shouldn't rely too much on any particular data point, but by gathering a few samples in each category, we can begin to see patterns and get in touch with our personal preference scheme on the relative weight of each category.

And so we have begun the journey to rational decision-making. Even if we haven't yet reached the end, at least we have overcome writer's block.
