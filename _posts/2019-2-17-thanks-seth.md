Step 1: create. Step 2: discern.

It's linear. It's simple.

I work in the reverse order by default. Except it doesn't really work. It's nonlinear; it's complicated.

What have I done in the past year? What did I do yesterday?

Sadly, I have run out of answers. Happily, I listened to Tim Ferriss's [interview with Seth Godin](https://tim.blog/2016/02/10/seth-godin/){:target="_blank"}.

I guess even now&mdash;here in this very blog post!&mdash;my brain is trying to discern. It's sneaky. These questions are bad: they are wrong, they are out of order.

My brain is good at analyzing, dissecting, discriminating. But I haven't really run out of answers. The "evidence" only points to one thing.

The first step is to create. To _do_. I should ask myself what I did yesterday tomorrow.
