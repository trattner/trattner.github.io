We love to go around and judge things. Shopping, the Oscars, politics. Don't you agree?

Without judgment, you can't do better than random. There is no progress. It's useful.

Does the act of judging bring joy?

Certainty, confidence, control&mdash;perhaps.

Unbridled warm fuzzies and life-changing moments of gratitude&mdash;perhaps not.

Do yourself a favor and tickle your emotion buttons. Then engage with cool rationality.

Ask what there is to be grateful for.

Joy before judgement is a powerful one-two punch. The opponent falls sooner than we'd expect.
