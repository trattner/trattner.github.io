We can understand, deeply, how one thing leads to another.

Because we believe in gravity, for example, we take the stairs instead of jumping off the third floor balcony.

Things get tricky when every day brings new experiences. Nothing about our modern, fast-paced lives and world even vaguely resembles the constancy of gravity.

Sometimes, we find ourselves in a burning building. We might have left the stove on, or maybe someone else did. Regardless, the third floor balcony is our only choice.

And that is the moment we learn to climb, or leap gracefully, and survive.

We can't change gravity, but we can heal, learn, grow.

We'll remember to check the smoke detectors next time.
