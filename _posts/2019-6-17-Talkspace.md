"If I had not found this website, I would not be here today."

As in, alive and existing on this planet. That's a powerful statement. A wonderful testiment to the quality of the service.

But the bigger the service's scale, the more challenging high quality becomes. There may be more of these testimonials overall, but are there more per every hundred customers?

Someone told me that it's a losing battle to try differentiating a large-scale mental health service on quality. They recommended finding different axes on which to compete.

I'm still not sure about the answer here, but I'm leaning towards disagreement.

It may be exponentially hard to prevent a widening distribution of interactions and outcomes as volume increases, but it may be an even higher order of "worth-it" to figure out how.
