When we talk about wanting things, and I mean _really_ wanting them, we have to ask the question: what are we willing to do to get what we want?

If we aren't willing to get up at 5am and go to the gym _every single day_, then maybe we don't actually want big nice muscles.

If we aren't willing to sit down and write a manuscript _before the deadline_, then maybe we don't actually want to be a professional writer.

If we aren't willing to earn _and save_ enough to buy that Tesla, then maybe we don't actually want a beautiful car.

Prioritized action is the currency of desire. A focused will realizes goals by stepping towards them. A thoughtless mouth stands still, smothering itself (and those nearby) with heavy words and hot air.

We are what we want, and we want what we do.
