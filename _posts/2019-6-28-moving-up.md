_[The Richest Man in Babylon](https://smile.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-Original-1926/dp/1508524351/){:target="_blank"}_ teaches a powerful and simple mindset for life through cute, short parables.

The mindset is hard to describe. I'd say it has a lot to do with understanding the power of decisions. How our actions compound over time. How each day, we shape our present identity, our future destiny, and the world around us.

A friend recently articulated a desire to "move up in the world", and I didn't quite understand what he meant. Was it about money, status, influence, decision-making agency, or some other form of success?

A lot of these words have negative connotations. "Not quite," my friend informed me. "It's more about having solid relationships and genuine connections. I want to be able to help my family and other people I care about."

It would be nice if everyone could expand the circle of people they care about, and also their capacity to help those people. In this way, we could all move up together.

I recommend the book not because it helps your finances (which it does), but even more than that, because it shares meaningful stories.

Stories which catalyze reflection. Stories which help us calibrate our values and actions. Stories which are short, sweet, and punchy.

Stories that are worth sharing.

Stories that help us move up.

Check out the audiobook from a library near you. "It costs nothing to ask wise advice from a good friend." Now _that_ is a great investment.
