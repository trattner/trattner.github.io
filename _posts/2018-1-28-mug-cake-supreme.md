Holy cow. It was so good. And legitimately healthy-ish.

Last night, I just threw a bunch of stuff together and I am insanely proud of the result. Thank you Manuj for sharing with me. Sadly, we were too busy devouring it so I neglected to take a photo. Next time...

List of Ingredients (note that when I made it, things were dumped not measured):

- 1 banana, ripe is better
- 3 Tbsp. almond milk or related liquid
- 1 Tbsp. canola or related oil
- 3 Tbsp. honey
- 1 egg
- 3 Tbsp. peanut butter, crunchy duh
- 4 Tbsp. oats
- 2 Tbsp. flour
- 1 Tbsp. flaxseed
- lots of Nutella
- fork for mixing

Take a big mug and peel the banana into it. With your fork, mush it up into a paste until you're bored. Suck it up and deal with remaining chunks, or not. Mix in milk, oil, honey, and egg. Also peanut butter. Beat until airy, light, and fluffy. How you are supposed to tell what's even vaguely light and fluffy, I have no clue.

Dump in some oats, stir a bit, and add half as much flour. Flaxseed if you have it, to make the dough more meaty. Other dry ingredients as you like. Maybe some sesame seeds would be nice.

You probably won't be mad later if you add more honey and peanut butter at this point. The consistency we are going for is approximately gooey oatmeal but not quite super super sticky. Cake batter, but a bit thicker. If you have to add more dry stuff or milk or oil, and the batter is anywhere near or over 75% of your mug, maybe grab another and divide into two half-mug portions. It rises in the microwave.

Microwave on high for 3 minutes. Perhaps put a paper towel underneath if your mug was full. No covering needed. You know it's cooked when there is maybe 30-80% dry land at the top of your mug, with some permanent air holes baked in. There will probably be a tiny bit of goo leftover, but under the surface everything should be pretty well done.

I like to dump my mug cake into a bowl or onto a plate, and then coat completely in Nutella. If you had them, you probably should have put some chocolate chips into the batter, but honestly the dough was so good without them when I did this. Enjoy!

Let me know if you try this recipe! Would love real people suggestions for portions of ingredients or any improvements! mugcake (at) atratt (dot) com
