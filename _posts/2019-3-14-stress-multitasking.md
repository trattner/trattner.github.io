It's generous to do only that which will delight. To make one's life a gift to others. Art rather than burden.

How the heck do we get there?

Tracing stress is one way to begin. If multiple things are on the mind, then it's going to be stuck in a costly cycle.

To focus biological needs and propel forward, a single source of stress can be good.

More than one, however, and it suddenly becomes much easier to hide.

What a joy to sit down and tackle meaningful work!

What a joy being beholden to myself!

What a joy to exercise the freedom our ancestors built!

Decide to take your stress to the chopping block, and don't look back.
