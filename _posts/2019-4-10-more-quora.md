I wrote another [thing](https://www.quora.com/Do-scientist-well-know-whats-happening-during-anxiety-in-the-brain/answer/Andy-Trattner){:target="_blank"} on Quora today. Then I [did it again](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-being-a-women-put-you-at-greater-risk-of-having-anxiety/answer/Andy-Trattner){:target="_blank"}.

This is a pretty fun activity, and I nearly didn't blog.

It will be important to proceed with caution.

For one, it's addictive. Which can become problematic. I found myself checking the stats too frequently. Got my first upvotes!

And, of course, Quora is a business. Just like Facebook, just like LinkedIn. I am the product that they sell. Part of this whole blogging thing is to assert myself and take back control.
