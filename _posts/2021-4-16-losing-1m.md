title: How I Lost A Million Dollars

I joined [Scale AI](https://scale.com) just before it became a unicorn. This past week, the company [attained a $7B valuation](https://scale.com/blog/series-e).

Not accounting for dilution, the stock options I was offered have grown ~70x in value. To give you an idea, that's like being given $15,000 worth of stock and having it grow to become more than $1,000,000 in less than two years.

If Scale grows even more, to the size of Coinbase for example, then that stock could be easily worth over $10,000,000 someday soon.

I have access to none of it because I resigned after less than a year working there.

The thing about founding, or joining an early-stage company, or quitting your nice tech job early to pursue something else (perhaps as crazy as living in the Ecuadorian wilderness), is that it's a big risk.

And folks who are lucky enough to be able to take such risks confidently&mdash;to swing for the fences and likely survive while learning from big mistakes&mdash;such folks will be in a position such that they can surely do it again.
