I will remember 2019 as the year I became an adult. It was a great year:
- I committed to an occupation,
- Embraced responsibility for my finances,
- Discovered my hero in Seth Godin,
- Wrote 121 blog posts,
- Transitioned fully to a stable home in San Francisco,
- Made significant strides in personal relationships and created incredible new ones,
- Developed healthy balance, focus, gratitude, patience, and
- Adopted more nuanced, thoughtful perspectives.

This past year, I gained much insight into my strengths and weaknesses. I’m grateful for my many experiences and resultant strengths, including
- High EQ and IQ
- Genuine, kind disposition
- Hustle, grit, resilience, optimism, adaptiveness
- Curiosity, joyfulness
- Ambition, boundary-pushing, contrarian quaintness

And I’m very excited to improve on my weaknesses, such as
- Focus, balance
- Direct confrontation and self-challenge, applying strictness over leniency
- Impulsivity, self-gratification, short-term thinking
- Money management and habits in general
- Being concise, direct, purposeful in thought, action, speech

Looking back at the phases that led me here, I would give the following breakdown:
- 1996-2000: infancy
- 2001-2005: childhood
- 2006-2012: autopilot middle high school adolescence growth
- 2013-2015: experimental exploration, start of college, onset of critical thought
- 2016-2018: ill-defined values, lack of direction, end of college, existential confusion
- 2019-present: foundational adulthood

Ten years ago, I was midway through eighth grade. Since then, I’ve learned so much. Probably more than in the preceding decade, largely thanks to the hyper-connectedness of the modern world. Each year I grew into a different, better person. Although there were some stagnant moments and plateaus, recently as the new year develops I find myself awe-struck and humbler each day contemplating the vast opportunities for further progress that yet await...both for myself, and for our world.

Looking forward to 2030, I’m excited about
1. Cultivating everlasting relationships
2. Investing my personal leverage to the betterment of life on earth
3. Continuing to develop and grow and learn and give thanks

In the next year, I will especially focus my time and energy on:
1. Being healthy, mindful, present.
2. Doing a great job at work.
3. Shipping side projects to learn and grow technically.

I will explicitly de-prioritize:
- Playing chess.
- Excessive reading and other content consumption or passive learning.
- Efforts to optimally save or invest money.
- Social and romantic engagements.

Hopefully, I will publish life updates here each month. Click “Join” below if you’d like to get them hot off the press (via email).

Don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to get in touch (“contact” below). I welcome spontaneous phone calls and prolonged voicemail tag. I’m especially keen on discussing:
- awesome humans looking for awesome career opportunities (we’re [hiring at Scale](https://scale.com/careers){:target="_blank"}, for many diverse&mdash;and non-software&mdash;roles!)
- unusual ideas to make $10k, for example not through vanilla investing (e.g. stocks) or selling labor time.

Sincere, tearful, joyous thanks to everyone who has been a part of this delightful journey.
