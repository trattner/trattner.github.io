Computers are great. Fire and the wheel get a lot of credit. As does the cotton gin, and the assembly line...

But when I think of all the technologies ever used by humans, money and language really stand out.

These tools enable interchange and organization.

On the surface level, money changes hands. Numbers and letters help us set the clocks properly.

Going a bit deeper, we see the roles flip.

Words [magically](/writing-magic) take the seeds from our brains and sow them elsewhere, cross-pollinating.

And [currency coordinates people](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/budget_fy22.pdf) around [ripened ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).

The atomic bomb, fossil fuels, and manufactured viruses might be powerful enough to halt if not destroy civilization.

But that's a capped outcome, with entropy as the tail wind.

Money and language are much more powerful. They allow us to fight the infinite uphill battle of [building](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/) our [society](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/budget_fy22.pdf).

Are we pushing the conversation forward? Are we incentivizing beneficial efforts?
