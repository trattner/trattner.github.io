I maintain an evolving [list of influences](/influences). It helps me think through which books have greatly impacted me.

I rarely encounter such life-changing content. Consideration-worthy items pop up at most once per month, and these thoughts usually arise from momentary passion as opposed to enduring resonance. The majority fade, forgotten.

Last weekend [visiting Maya's mountain in Vilcabamba](/visit), I had the immense pleasure of finishing 3 books. Two of them didn't do much for me.

The first book, _[Fight Club](https://smile.amazon.com/Fight-Club-Novel-Chuck-Palahniuk/dp/0393355942/)_, was great as a movie. I shouldn't talk about it too much, but start with the writing if you aren't familiar and want to enjoy both. Going in the other direction doesn't work. (Loved Tim Ferriss interviewing [Palahniuk](https://tim.blog/2020/09/02/chuck-palahniuk/) and [Norton](https://tim.blog/2019/10/31/edward-norton-motherless-brooklyn/).)

The second book, _[Better Than Good](https://smile.amazon.com/BETTER-THAN-GOOD-Zig-Ziglar/dp/0785289194/)_, was one of the only Zig Ziglar texts that I could find from [San Francisco's e-collection](https://sfpl.overdrive.com/). He's [often cited by Seth](https://seths.blog/?s=zig+ziglar), so I thought it would be worth a try. After a few pages, however, there were too many references to God and too few insights for me to continue. I guess I didn't really finish this one...just decided to be done with it.

But the third book, _[Educated](https://tarawestover.com/book)_, leapt onto the list! Bill Gates was right, it was [even better than I had heard](https://www.gatesnotes.com/books/educated). In case this gem hasn't yet reached your ears, here's my synopsis:

>Tara Westover shares how she grew up without school until she was old enough to escape her cult-like family. Surviving abuse, neglect, and near-death to land in a foreign academic world, she eventually managed to get a PhD.

After devouring all 300+ pages in a single evening, I sent the author a thank-you email. I [tend to do that when inspired](/positive-sum). This book had some of the most brave and powerful writing I've ever encountered. I cried multiple times as I journeyed vicariously through arbitrary pain and increasingly meaningful struggle.

Digesting Dr. Westover's humbling memoir, I've hit a creative slump&mdash;in a good way. I'm re-visiting my preconceived notions of what a book can be and what it can do.

I'm looking forward to posting a few notes for each book I read going forward. (Like my [reflections on life logistics](/value-expression), these may or may not coincide with the weekly blog email.)

Even if the bar is raised so high that I can no longer visualize my own memoir taking shape in the same way as before, through blogged book reviews I can at least practice weaving a bit of story and insight together, narrating as I go.

Let me worship the [sacrament of the written word](/writing-magic) with an open mind and a grateful heart.
