- how did warren buffet push himself?

- what globalization means? mechanical turk vs scale. trajectory of products, slow/fast design curve impact with legacy and lots of maintance / existing customers changes harder. working within company: see how to use contractors, tools of modern world and tech, assimilate this, also working gives idea of what slow fast means, what design curve and product development entails, org, etc.

- respecting colleague asks vs thinking they are dumb, uninformed, and everyone is inefficient. wow and amaze by people around you. important. huge. biggest thing ever. speaks to collective, individual, etc. need to constant improve mindset. or at least appreciate and reflect on it. not glaze over, get offended, or minimize / say no out of hand. disproportionate response. well-calibrated responses key. reasonable. ACTUALLY motivated for real.

- open office plan simply budget saver. requires going into office = putting on headphones but doesn't work, only removes one thing in environment senses out of 5. 20% better... so sad and hard to code concentrate do output.

- might seem best to have people give you work with no deadline, or far away for you to prioritize your stack and work thru. but also could start with immediate deadlines, see how it goes, learn, do it again, and then you just get everything done and know exactly what to ask people to forecast. don't know exactly without testing those conditions and running thru tight hoops. what does a rush look like? do I need to be rushing? these questions cannot answer completely / thoroughly / thoughtfully without experience as data and reasoning with examples.

- strategy: you want to prioritize your high-impact work while makingf everyone else believe truly that you prioritize them

- Elon's formula: pick something not perfect, work on it til changed sufficiently/fixed, repeat.

- critical to start with assumptions. but I like few as possible. need to understand all branches to deep depth. also part of elon formula. Tejas "I don't have much visibility to customers" sure part of role, but I don't have much visibility to eng and product except yes I do. I must.

- problems don't go away. solve them minimally to move forward and focus on most important ones. don't stress or spend any time on rest. only focus.
