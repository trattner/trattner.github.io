post ideas:

- appreciation comes from understanding what something could be. kill because don't understand the other person could become our best friend. Over-eat and not exercise because don't see selves as being future humans. Don't try to build wealth because not awake to the possibility of it. Often the most successful are the most grateful, humble, kind. Becauase they recognized oppotunities where others didn't see them. They appreciated. It's a skill, appreciation is recognition. Love is the act of moving towards that appreciated state. When you love someone you act on your appreciation. You do things for them. You sacrifice, but it's also in the long-term interests of yourself. giving selflessly is one of the best investments we can make. Karma, etc. many recognize this. So when you devote more action, more resources to your daily coffee than your sibling living in a far-off palce, you are loving it more. lead with appreciation. live with love.

- PM is about knowing how to answer any question about a project on the spot all the time. timeline, deliverables, next steps, impact.

- Vienna so grateful to have convesation, shared death tidbit memories. one second video gives purpose to get out and sieze the day, gratitude, fun, doing things with life worth remembering each day.

- Vienna process good life morality thoughts on living in the woods -- if someone paid you would you do it? blob of humanity vs indian reservation isolation, more people / man-made good or bad? entropy always increasing so more efforts tech CEO maybe bad externalities overall with progress. My argument is human blob has bigger impacts, definitely inefficiencies and can reduce entropy by working in this domain vs small scale of self in woods. Not sure answer here. What brings personal utility? Work for job maybe don't enjoy, losing touch with humanity? Fairness of accessibility to jobs / influence / power. big system gives smaller chances for you to be impactful?  

- how did warren buffet push himself?

- what globalization means? mechanical turk vs scale. trajectory of products, slow/fast design curve impact with legacy and lots of maintance / existing customers changes harder. working within company: see how to use contractors, tools of modern world and tech, assimilate this, also working gives idea of what slow fast means, what design curve and product development entails, org, etc.

- respecting colleague asks vs thinking they are dumb, uninformed, and everyone is inefficient. wow and amaze by people around you. important. huge. biggest thing ever. speaks to collective, individual, etc. need to constant improve mindset. or at least appreciate and reflect on it. not glaze over, get offended, or minimize / say no out of hand. disproportionate response. well-calibrated responses key. reasonable. ACTUALLY motivated for real.

- open office plan simply budget saver. requires going into office = putting on headphones but doesn't work, only removes one thing in environment senses out of 5. 20% better... so sad and hard to code concentrate do output.

- might seem best to have people give you work with no deadline, or far away for you to prioritize your stack and work thru. but also could start with immediate deadlines, see how it goes, learn, do it again, and then you just get everything done and know exactly what to ask people to forecast. don't know exactly without testing those conditions and running thru tight hoops. what does a rush look like? do I need to be rushing? these questions cannot answer completely / thoroughly / thoughtfully without experience as data and reasoning with examples.

- strategy: you want to prioritize your high-impact work while makingf everyone else believe truly that you prioritize them

- Elon's formula: pick something not perfect, work on it til changed sufficiently/fixed, repeat.

- critical to start with assumptions. but I like few as possible. need to understand all branches to deep depth. also part of elon formula. Tejas "I don't have much visibility to customers" sure part of role, but I don't have much visibility to eng and product except yes I do. I must.

- problems don't go away. solve them minimally to move forward and focus on most important ones. don't stress or spend any time on rest. only focus.

On the planet Eieio,

money coordinates people around ideas. also people but not as duh.



interesting people interest you. They entertain. Consistently. Taking you on a ride, a journey, a learing adventure. Timeframes. watching tree grow vs bamboo shoots...



Interesting people interest you. That is, you are drawn to them&mdash;their quirks, curiosity, joy, sordid.
