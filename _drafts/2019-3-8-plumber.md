Not enough people think this way. I can spread it.

That's a lie, an excuse. A generality to hide behind for the normal curve.

Actually, I don't know yet. Let me try again now. Then tomorrow. And again.

I sent someone an email. The response was polite but firm

Through crowded streets and intersections, Bonnie scurries into work. "Man, what a congested morning in this city!" Avoiding the main thoroughfare was the sole reason she made it in time to the meeting.

What a joy to be able to sit down and do meaningful work!
What a joy to be beholden to myself.
What a joy to exercise the freedom our ancestors built.

- update: oh I guess I'll do this totally different thing
BAD.
- shows why person emailed response. they detected it.
- hepl busy people to get their time
