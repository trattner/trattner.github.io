I'm an [engineer](/img/18c-diploma.png){:target="_blank"} with the heart of an educator and the spirit of an entrepreneur. I currently live in Ecuador, where I am working on [payments infrastructure](https://banconect.com). I've dabbled in [blogging](/blog) and a [podcast](https://theandypod.com) or [two](https://yupandcoming.com), thanks to Seth Godin as one of my biggest [influences](/influences). I very much enjoy the [food industry](https://world.hey.com/tratt/el-gordo-sano-is-dead-be56520a), [poker](/poker), and [chess](/chess).
