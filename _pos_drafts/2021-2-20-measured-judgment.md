Seth talks about slack in system.

When we're thinking long term, properly and well, we're often informed by experience and judgment. we want to be measured and correct.

if we're deciding on the price to pay for a plot of land or a car, if we're crossing the street, we don't want to be way off, and there's a zone where we're comfortable. We shave off the slack so we know our sweet spot thru experieince, but we don't time it so precisely that the car is nipping at our ankles right as we reach the other side.

You develop maturity and better decision-making and usually, want to have a balance between racing to the bottom and the top.

If you're selling someone a product that involves a marketing funnel based on interruption and clickbait, then you can dial that hack and grow it tuning each part of your funnel. This is skating on razor wire, tensely, contstantly scraping more value from the world.

Or you can paint generously with broad strokes. You can only work with people who really want to work with you. You can just write the book you wanted to write, instead of dialing in the book others want to buy, and if 2 people buy it then they probably gained something serious from it, even if that thing is only supporting you.

If you're ready to wait for the 10x whales who make a difference, it's important. and you will be leveraging yourself and moving forward and building more experience with the appropriate guiderails, when you choose this mindset and approach.

Scale AI had a fine-wire approach, as does Uber, etc.

People (Cheryl Ward) often say one thing but did the other. Economics push toward the former; self-actualization and humanity, expression, culture, really push emotionally vs logically in other direction.

This happens to be religious, mystical, long-term, you don't see day-to-day or nicely ready examples.

There are realities you can't usually do what I'm doing which isn't so generous needs to be faster for sure. Also I am weird for moving in this direction so forcefully, so step-oscillatory because I know it's true and correct.

Most folks however, could probably learn to move in the other direction, or just a better direction, with more slack.
