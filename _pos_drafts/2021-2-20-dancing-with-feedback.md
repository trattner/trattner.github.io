title: Dancing with Feedback

Feedback is one of the most important components to doing anything meaningful.

YC says "make something people want"

Lean Startup says "faster learning cycles" = startup progress.

As my sister points out, talking to customers is the most important thing to do early on, to really discover what people want, how they live their lives, and how the contribution you seek to make fits in.

Some of the best feedback comes when you present folks with an actual thing to get feedback on.

If you come up to someone and tell them an idea, a likely reaction is "that's nice, that's cool"

If you come up to someone with a product and say will you buy it, they'll tell you "yes or no, and here's why".

Projects have to get off the ground with some amount of personal vision. Why are you asking someone about your idea in the first place? You have to have a hunch that something is valuable to others first.

(PG says best creator is in or recently part of the product demographic.)

One barrier that holds people back is the competitive / comparative differentiation. You don't want to make a cheap burger joint because it seems McDonald's beat you to it. You don't want to write a book on writing because Stephen King and many others what can you possibly say that's new. You don't want to create a search engine because Google has already won.

I have a couple friends who are incredibly wary of giving advice for fear of being too general, not authoritative or expert on particular subjects, having ideas which don't or won't resonate with those who hear them.

There's wisdom in this, of course, but when it comes to writing or blogging, and thinking you don't have anything of value to say (which I Confront at least once per week now), the best remedy is to try.

Maybe all the things have been said before. But even if the words are out there, the question is, whose ears are listening?

You don't get paralyzed when you wake up and think, I have nothing new to do or contribute to the world today! You just get going, you talk to folks throughout your day, you have dinner with friends or family and you say things informed by your experiences. You might talk about your life, new phenomena, or old themes other folks have already spoken about. Calling out old themes in a new context is interesting, with new examples, personal or otherwise. The more individuals think about universal truths like EA topics, climate change, the more our collective will veers in a good direction for large-scale action.

Thinking more about the delivery mechanism, it's important to understand who are you speaking to....new ears need to hear things, people are going about their days, their lives, and they haven't heard the same things as you and they haven't read all the books.

And they have a hunger to learn, to grow, to go places...they're often waiting to be led. (Seth tells us in Tribes).

If you're first person at the bus stop outside my window i will hear you whether i like or not, so better be good not wasteful.

You can provide value in reaching folks who haven't heard whatever things new or old.

Because people are alive and going about their days, there always will be proliferation of content and discussion, and it's ok to participate in that.

Good enough original things will stay, people will read the best-selling book, but not everyone...and even if Seth Godin is the OG maybe I can synthesize his ideas in a better way that's more useful for future generations or just non-Seth demographics like people who follow my blog but not his. Brett tried both and decided Seth was the right one for him. Other folks do me for other reasons but regardless are listening to what I'm saying.

So even if you don't hear me cite him, I clearly pull from him in almost every way but of course I do add my own experiences and twists and thoughts and things not on brand for him.

Regurgitated ideas all day long also sometimes have a relatively new one. Chess books for example is big idea shift rather unique....chess is not new, minigames aren't new, but putting them together with stories and accessibly has created some memorable moments like this recent comment:
[quote from marriage saving lady]

For a long time I thought I had nothing to say, I thought chess is so covered, it's the most covered sport / game ever actually.

But also it's taken 2+ years to just keep waking up and writing stuff down and blogging to put out random stuff and eventually I get some feedback, I see some patterns, and I can refine and hone what I'm making to be useful.
