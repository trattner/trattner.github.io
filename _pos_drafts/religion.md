This morning, attended a service for  Buddha Amitabha (Pure Land Buddhism).

It was nice, sitting by a fire, bathing in the chanting
There is a magic to devotion, to selfish release, to higher powers
To wishing others merit
To prostrating oneself and adopting the fool and servant's mentality

But salvation and other rights of passage
Reading texts and adhering to principles formulated by others
For me, it is first-principles which speak loudest
Gratitutde is good, gratitude to the Buddha, not so sure
