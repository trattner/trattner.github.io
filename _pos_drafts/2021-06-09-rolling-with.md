I missed my flight this week from Quito to Loja. It was scheduled for Sunday but I thought Monday, so when I showed up at the airport, I received a nasty shock. The next one would be Wednesdya and the fee would be eighty percent of the ticket price. I am coming back to quito anyway on Friday to meet up with my sister, so all the hassle or taking a bus wouldn't be woth it.

I made a list of chores I anted to get done back in Loja. I wanted to clean my apartment, get some mail, see some people, visit my property and neighbors, bunch of stuff online like finishing my book. Turns out all of this is non-essential, or I can do it remotely, like cleaning the apartment my landlady is a pro and happy to help.

I booked myself a nice hotel with a great view of the city. I can spend more time with people in Quito I wanted to see. I have focus zone in my hotel to do the things I wanted, even more so than back in my apartment distracted with other things, non-essential. And oh boy access to lots of great food here! Arepas wow.

I'm lucky of course it's a bit more expensive but not crazy.

After an hour in the airport, shocked,
Definitely a case of making lemonade.
