After working through 5 initial consultations with different providers, I was excited to dive in with my [therapist of choice](https://www.rebekahtinker.com/meet-rebekah) last Friday, March 12.

Since I don't have a strong singular issue at the moment, we explored my goals and mindset broadly. One topic that came up will be no surprise to folks who know me&mdash;my battle for productivity.

Since finishing high school in 2014, I have had a bad habit of spotaneously playing chess online. It's dangerous how easy (and momentarily rewarding) it is to pop open a browser tab or phone app to quickly finish off a 1 or 3 minute game.

Other folks might check email or social media; this is common, this is normal. For me it's chess. And binging anime, movies, Google News. Walking around town trying new bakeries and restaurants.

Looking from the outside, one might think I don't really have a productivity problem. My life is pretty great, and my output is high when it needs to be. Everyone has these mild addictive behaviors and vices.

This is all correct, if I'm being compared with the average person. I've held this view myself for the past decade, sweeping my procrastination under the rug of relative achievement.

But it's time to more thoughtfully examine if this is the best I can do. Why do I continue when I know these activities aren't fulfilling? Can I build more discipline, better habits? Or should I accept myself as I am?

Talking this through helped articulate a few parts of myself that are responsible for various mindstates and behavior patterns. We have:

1. **The goal setting idealist**, who's ambitious and not quite happy with the status quo. This is the part of me which is driven to squash all the bad habits in service of more productivity. But it's also not so extreme or self-flagellating as it could be, since it recognizes that I have accomplished a fair amount with my current blend of good and bad habits.

2. **The distracted self**, who falls into patterns of binging netflix and aimlessly wandering around town. This is the part that mindlessly plays game after game without improving.

3. **The inner quiet self** who is most content reading and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. Similar to the distracted self, but with no regrets. Time in this mode feels very well-spent learning, authentically socializing, running or otherwise basking in nature enjoying the present moment.

Many folks probably relate to these. I've previously thought along the same lines before too. But it never led to any deep insight or behavior change, despite copious journaling and self-reflection.

I hope that this time, we can drive this reflection deeper, to unlock serious self-understanding and behavior change. There are three factors or supportive pillars to this end, which are encouraging.

1. Intention and Accountability. I'm finally ready to put my money where my mouth is, paying $175 out of pocket weekly for a professional therapist to help me stay on track.

2. Practice and Exercises. My therapist is helping to encourage me to take productive steps to formalize insights and explore more deeply. For example the prompt to write and reflect on these different selves, and I'm going to start keeping a journal to document when I feel myself shifting into a particular state, and explore why / what is going on.

3. Language and Framework. Building up a conceptual model to not just have one-off journal entries but a comprehensive theory of mind is empowering and useful, the theory to guide the application of point 2. Everyone can develop their own language of course, and the parts of mind sound very [Minskian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind), but my therapist is also bringing a wealth of knowledge and resources which I find relevant so far.

This blog post combines points 2 + 3, specifically looking at the titular psychotherapy model as explained by this [outline doc](/img/pdf/ifs-outline.pdf) and [Lovelink podcast episode 28 on IFS](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6l6IcN87IxvE1C1W4AfA5Z?si=zv7ichTnT9aoMfuEaG2f-g).

Perusing these source material has led to an articulation of even more parts:

- Controller / competent part, blends with self a lot. Says no therapy needed, can do everything on my own. Overconfident, overoptimistic, doesn't listen to others, does stuff, just launches in, needs to prove self wrong. Doesn't like to learn new things from others, tends to make complicated equations in physics vs understanding underlying concept. Impatient, which leads to worse / more time costly results when executing.

Fears being incapable, defenseless, weak, dependent. Disdains others and own self state. exile is reliance (space for connection)


- Idealist / ambitious part, blends with self a lot. Sets extreme goals, likes to make detailed plans, needs projects and outsized impact to feel useful and worthy of living, finds these things give life meaning. competitive.

Fears being useless, non-contributing, scorn / shame. taking, dependence, unworthy to live, meaningless life, nihilism. Exile is emptiness (space for love)


- Quiet / learning / reflective part - blended / core self. curious, open, present, reads books, flowing, domestic and calm self, enjoys cooking, probably most often treated as an 8 y.o or 7-9 y.o. sitting on sofa at home in mequon reading harry potter and having sleepovers, building houses of cards, etc.

in exile (space for being wrong). learning like a kid


- binge firefighter, sensual, shiny, distractor - blended. narrative of eternal life, enjoying, splurging money, external acts of validation which need to happen as best thing to do right now. holds strong narrative of enjoying life, short term thinking, type 1 fun. very spontaneous, adventurous, highly convincing to other parts

fears stillness, having nothing to do, not enjoying or "spending" life. fears failure, hard work, challenge. exile is challenge (space for growth)


- disdainful / judgmental part - blended - looks down on dumb / inefficient stuff, post-facto to binge firefighter, manager, not happy with world or self, always sees better.

fears inadequacy, protected exile is vulnerability, weakness (space for softness, important/impotent? growth)


overfriendly-pleasing part fears not being well-received, loved. Exile is loneliness (space for loving oneself)



From just listing these, and listening to system existing external influence, clear thought emerges which is that Ecuador was an external way to let more Self time happen, since removing distractions and less judgment and removing environment which leads to less ambitious competitive.




Who are they?
What is their agenda or intent?
Do they protect another part of you, and/or are they protected by another part?
How long have they been a part of you?
Describe their personality, what they look like, etc.
