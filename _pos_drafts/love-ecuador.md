title: what i love about ecuador
date: tbd
---

nature
going places without need for cell phone
people nice
language / culture, novelty and down-to-earth mentality
economy is decent, don't see rampant poverty, and very cheap
developed developing country -- basic needs easily met, nice downtown buildings
climate and weather are beautiful
USD
not so many expats, lots of locals, yet friendly and very moderate in all things
traditional food, local produce, eggs, earth is so central
innovative and practical people
altitude and whatever i feel fit
rent is < 200 mo, comfortably
hammocks!
air yoga for $5


downsides? (Michael says greatest strengths often have flip side)
too much nature, scorpion, snake, big spider, cows -- yet again, andes minimal insect / mosquito, and very chill vibes
not uber, need spanish, and looking like local may help, i'm a dude and don't look rich
financial logistics and friction with visa etc, investor helps
on you to verify everything and ask the right questions, stuff isn't set in stone and police can be bribed, local recourse for cow damage, otherwise stuck out of luck, no gas, water from mountain hose, etc....life takes work, not nutrition labels etc, no insurance, no public library, government slow
job opportunities def less, remote necessary, professor good job makes 30k, minimum wage is 4k, many people
construction and buildings are pretty shoddy
cant flush toilet paper, hot water scarce
buses don't have route maps, ask driver
earthquakes and landslides


good fit for me because:
- i hustle
- enjoy talking with locals, joyful
- spanish
- chill vibes, very easy to distinguish work / life, no pressures with friends etc
- nature, career already off to a good start, remote access
- have cash and want to stretch it
- working on self by living here, fitness with air altitude / diet, and being more comfortable with life / death and relating to insects, nice challenge
- diversifying the life portfolio when USA goes to shit
