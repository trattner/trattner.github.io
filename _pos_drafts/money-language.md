Computers are great. Fire and the wheel get a lot of credit. As does the cotton gin, and the assembly line.

But when I think of all the tools ever used by humans, money and language really stand out.

They enable interchange and organization.

On the surface level, money changes hands. Numbers and letters help us coordinate the clocks.

Going a bit deeper, we see that it's flipped.

We use the [magic of words](/writing-magic) to take the seeds in our brains and sow them elsewhere. Then we use the fuel of currency to coordinate people around certain ideas that have ripened.

The 21st century is a remarkable time. We live awash in a sea of information, under a waterfall of accessible knowledge, with a hurricane of exponentially proliferating language on the horizon.

It's more important than ever to deliberately navigate, to mind what we pay attention to, and to steer our ship of limited resources in such a way that we'll have more abundance tomorrow.

And
magic of money -- better than governments, better than anything -- at getting stuff done. how do you build a house, execution of ideas. remarkable times where purchasing power is higher than ever, many more ways to live and to work and to do anything than ever before. figuring out how is more fun/exciting/satisfying/customizably easy/ than ever.

although we don't really have a surplus of money, which tells us we have a lack of imagination or human species is running out of ideas/motivation to have ideas, very scary. also blessing of high quality of life, post-industrial, IT/tech-consolidated society.

also magic of money is universal measuring stick of value within system,
society is more liquid than ever
crypto-ization of economies allows us to formally and informally concretize incentives and organize in the right directions, one way to think about it
crypto is very american, markets woot mapping onto a domain
uber matches drivers to riders yes? maybe blockchain can do that
banks match accounts to people yes? definitely blockchain can do that (incentive endcase for netowork maintenance how paid?? or asymptotic)
ICANN matches domains to IP addresses.

yes decentralized motion in same direction, trust / alignment.
people not able to participate in economy is dangerous to society.
to themselves and society, since society not including them = they don't understand how to fit in.

talk of inflation, inflation good because measuing stick units get smaller?


enlightened capitalist thinks about how to gain and spend money thoughtfully. not willing to sell hours with limit upside
