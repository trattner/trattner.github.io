In [one of my first blog posts](/on-being), I expressed frustration with
College department of tagline

as someone who is always thinking,
identity
strength and weakness, bold moves and frequent changes
and you may notice re-writing about page
we talk about professional identity in podcast, kinda an obsession
how does one define one's life and james formulation

it's particularly hard when you're just starting out and your actions don't leave enough breadcrumbs to connect.
for some folks they are able to commit
for other's like me, it's more aspirational...I say I'm a writer and at the turn of this year I have started telling people that's my literal job, but honestly no I still feel I'm a professional software sales and customer success because that was my most successful and productive role

famous or older people don't matter
Seth for example, or Tim (doesn't matter once you got success, Tara westover)
her bio page is https://tarawestover.com/bio
but really who cares, it's amazing and she's already a millionaire so
"Below is a bio, awkwardly written in the third person. Because people keep asking me for it.
" -- often such preface

when I wrote [succeeding at being you](/being-you)

My impressive one
