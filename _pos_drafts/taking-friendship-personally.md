title: Taking Friendship Personally

A couple people close to me felt rejected by my decision to live in Ecuador for the next few years.

I was surprised at how negatively they responded, and especially the framings which place blame on my mentality, attitude, and choice.

"I will delete you from my phone and block you; I don't think we should talk anymore; It's clear you don't want a relationship with me."

"Can't you see that this is part of your impulsive behavior patterns which negatively damage your life? You always make choices like this and regret them later."

I do want relationships with you people, but not if you're going to react like this!
I don't regret hardly any of my past choices, especially the big ones which always teach me a lot about myself and the world. I may act differently in the future, but for now I don't think I can make any other choice and feel good about it, so I know I won't regret it.

The preferred response would be something like, "wow, that's so exciting, I'm happy for you and want to visit as much as possible in the future!" and if necessary "I am sad you are moving away and will miss seeing you more regularly, but understand that the best way for my friends to be happy isn't always staying close to me, so I won't take it personally and will try to see as much upside as possible...now I have a friend to visit in a new country and we can go to the Galapagos together, etc."

From my perspective, if we really have such a strong relationship, why can't it be continued through regular phone calls and connection at a distance? Especially during covid when we won't see each other much in-person anyway.

Life is too short for the reactive, self-centered, insecurity-driven response.

Love yourself.
Do things that make you happy.
Enjoy and live life.
Be kind to others.
