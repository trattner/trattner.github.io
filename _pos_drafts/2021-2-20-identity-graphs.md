Time horizon of months or years.
Taking on big projects and moving places and doing something new.
Boldly shifting time allocations (Ed Norton Tim Ferriss)

This is a step function, somehow I think it's like a Fourier series approaching the idealized step function. You think you're making this big leap from work / identity A to B, and reality actually has many harmonic fluctuations.


When I moved from vacation mode in Vilcabambaa to living in Loja full-time creative, I'm still going thru the oscillations weeks later. Moving to Ecuador.

When I started the podcast, it has been good and challenging and there are ideas on how to shape it differently.

writing the book, any project really.

Deciding to run every day or do 30 pushups, or 5 minutes of abs (Jenny),  such things efforts to step lead to unexpected daily emotional and physical differences, so over time you learn to anticipate these unexpected natural processes.

When we build in anticipation, we aren't surprised by reality and we accept bad days and moments, we appreciate and elongate the find more meaning in the good, instead of treating it as a passing thing we are ready to fully enjoy that sunset and know it's OK to pause here or there.


Time horizon of minutes or hours.
What does it mean to sit at a desk and change everything? (Drew)

When we encounter a dip or a slouch, could be for 3 minutes surfing the web instead of doing that important thing, or it could be for 3 months feeling unenergetic or 3 years sitting in a too-comfortable job not living our best life...during this time, it's essential to know how to escape.

There are inevitable such things, and we really don't have good natural instincts in confronting this stuff. Our brains suck at it. Tiger says better to do small things commit incrementally.

Concrete mechanics say, if you're sitting there in the slouch, to get out you really need to take a single step. You need to build a ramp out, and it starts with the first little thing.

What's the direction shift, what's the subproblem you could commit to right this moment. Maybe it's closing the browser tab. Whenever you open the browser tab for this addictive website, just close it. You don't have to tackle the problem of the important life work (yet). Start somewhere very achievable, just go.

Trigger in the correct direction, then subsequent trigger. Starts out consciously then becomes more worn pathway. "Motivation get's you started, habit keeps you going"
buid the stack of such triggers and you'll be on your way.

Knowing your self and the world well-enough to project manage in this bite-sized way is really important for creative work.
