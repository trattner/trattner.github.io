title: Judging Mannerisms
date: 2021-2-20

Snap judgments are easy to make and sometimes they are right.

I once played a kid in chess who picked his nose and just seemed so overly confident I knew he would play a fast out-witting style so I intentionally played a slower strategical game and capitalized on a minor misunderstanding / oversight in a drawn position in late middle-endgame transition on move 20-25.

(I know I'm going to cut that paragraph so now I'm stuck just thinking what a waste or something narrativizing shut up andy head keep going)

mannerisms are important, do people say please and thank you, are they holding the door, what kind of signals are they sending off.

This is even more important than I realized for dating and how the world perceives you with your clothes, etc. Getting foot in the door, talking and walking certain way is better, Seth talks about this too.

Yes, sometimes it's false and Joe Biden sadly demonstrates yes perhaps our judgments are the problem not the mannerisms.

But useful case for sticking it out with people I get annoying vibes from (Sam Van Cise) better to drop or others who pick up on small things and I've been proven completely wrong (Ashay)
