title: Judging vs Accepting

I see reflected in myself a yin-yang spectrum that's present in cultures at the global scale.

The white Western capitalist civilization is in part fueled by constant judgment. People comment and bicker about quality, is something the best. It's a means to understand and control reality. Power and efficiency are the goal, anxiety is the side effect. Guilt comes when judgment "that person is fat" conflicts with higher norms of politeness, which is deemed to be "correct" and other forms are wrong. I was implicitly taught at a young age that such a phrase would be judged mean, so instead we can say "that person is a bit bigger."

the culture is sharper, more neurotic, analytical. cleaving to truth and constantly trying to define it, put things in boxes.

seth godin has a gentle form of nudging us towards higher quality more humane business practices, marketing, improving culture. making things better by making better things. capitalism but with a dull edge, just right and enough for the job. or honed at a different angle, japanese knife instead of american style.

On the other hand, latin america and poor countries / people in general, perhaps driven by a need to accept circumstances in which they have less agency... becomes impolite, repulsive to not accept, to reject in favor of better, to aspire. to ambition. to go beyond the community, to leave and return different with knowledge of civilization, management practices.

A latin American will call someone a "gordito" or a "negrito" and the other person will casually embrace it. Normal, no worries, how can you say otherwise it's dumb to object. Hit back with a different nickname, but you don't get to change yours. It is decided by the others.

This may be eastern, dutiful acceptance. anesthetizing or coping / shielding / yielding into the humnan condition. means to achieve happiness, to enjoy and approach bliss with what we have on this earth in this universe, but also perhaps dulling the edge and sometimes leading to different conclusions and hows things should be done compared with the efficiency at all costs optimization mindset.

always a balance.
the latins can better understand quality, the importance of shared norms, of being on time, of being honest and providing quality service instead of ripping off tourists for a $5 taxi instead of $1.50 in the short term. price it (values) into the contract.
the americans can better understand chill. to take things less seriously. and to forget, to lose themselves in the magic realism of now. to be more tipsy, to live a harmonious life, to be more in touch with one's body and the earth, to be and feel like an animal.

it helps that i'm living in limbo, as a liminal figure, and i'm currently a bit tipsy.

(negrito nickname chill language thoughts culture etc)



western guilty judgment truth seeking, reality power actualizing ==> efficiency / anxiety / negativity / sharp

eastern dutiful acceptance reality shielding coping anesthetizing against human condition ==> happiness good attitude / positivity / balanced patience / dull
