I'm listening to [David Heinemeier Hansson's insightful conversation with Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2018/06/05/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-david-dhh-heinemeier-hansson/) and resonating strongly with the part starting around 2 hours 30 minutes and 40 seconds.

DHH is talking about role models in the business world. "When you meet your heroes...sometimes it's better just to have the idealized version...that you took away when you read their book." <!--and goes on to explain how meeting them in real life isn't necessarily fantastic. Through experience, he and Tim have both learned that it's often useful to respect someone's work by separating art from artist.

Tim gives the example of many anonymous someones trying to pitch him, unsolicited and cornered, in airport bathrooms. As the would-be heroic idol, he disclaims that he can't put on his investor hat properly while running to catch a plane. -->

DHH gives the example of fans who demand additional on-the-spot insight after reading his [books](/influences#rework).




Seth Godin essentially told me the same thing.
