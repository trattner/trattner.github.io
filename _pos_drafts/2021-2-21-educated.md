Tara Westover shares how she grew up without school until she was old enough to escape her cult-like family. Surviving abuse, neglect, and near-death to land in a foreign academic world, she eventually managed to get a PhD.

I've added this book to the [top of my "captivating and beautiful" influences list].

Dear Dr. Westover,

Thank you for your book. I stayed up late last night to finish it in one sitting, unable to tear myself away. _Educated_ is perhaps the most brave and powerful writing I've ever encountered.

As someone who also lacked adequate parenting, now contemplating a memoir of my own, I am flabbergasted and inspired by your incredibly dense stories and insights. For so many of life's complex facets, you've captured and related the essence. Your story is lucid, personal, horrifying, and beautiful. I cried multiple times as I journeyed with you through so much arbitrary pain and increasingly meaningful struggle. In my eyes, you've outdone or at least sit somewhere among Viktor Frankl, Sylvia Plath, C.S. Lewis.

I'm very grateful for your example, which is helping me in many ways beyond writing of my own. And I'm so, so sorry for the hurt you endured which never should have happened. Congratulations on continuing to survive and thrive and sense-make every day. Your hard work, your leadership, is changing lives.

Warmly,
Andy
