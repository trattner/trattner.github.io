we inflict trauma on others by not understanding our own trauma / warps
cyrus, lucas
normally we are kind etc
deviations come from place of non-love, place of instinct, need for control, fear
healing from place of love
nature and spiders sure accidents but we can confront those ok
the people stuff is crazy since we want approval, we seek and are disappointed / confused by others' motivations. we make stories around these deltas between expectations and reality, and they stick with us, we resent others for not seeing as we do.
