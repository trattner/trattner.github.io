Really impressed with IFS - file:///Users/atratt/Desktop/OurMultipleSelves.pdf, references GEB and other theories, origin story
applied model of self-understanding, systematic and beautiful culmination of biology neurology, self-management, academia, evolution of ideas and specialization
sheds beauty on the human condition to have such a theory adpated to practical use and articulated so well, like logotherapy for some reason haven't encountered it, weird...surprising, new, cool, exciting


therapy sesh today asked tough questions
the work i did was almost irrelevant after listening to tim ferris
(link to intro and [Richard Schwartz performing IFS therapy live on Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2021/01/14/richard-schwartz-internal-family-systems/))
that morning, today friday 19th, saw visual, sinking into the body, similar to what my therapist did for me but i couldn't answer well...had trouble locating these parts and articulating answers to certain questions
intellectualizing self is very blended and strong
outcome of need for more compassion, which is ironic and strange
don't i love myself and treat myself more than anyone i know?
oh wait, all those external means are actually stemming from internal imbalance, and lack
even though I say my childhood was nurturing, it wasn't and there was more critique than love expressed
mother and unconditional was absent, grammy was best representation there, dad was too practical and neurotic actually

also found the distinction between little boy who interjects to fill silence and seeks attention vs the pure innocent curious genuine one, and also some core nihilism which isn't represented in a body quite yet but very strongly keeps me grounded thru trial by fire of 10-16 y.o.
wow now i see aunt jenny probably hates herself and dave sucks at supporting and that whole family has dysfunctional horrible shit going on and nasty nasty unloved under-nurtured parts wow

paper discusses how being back home with family activates parts of us, which i find very true, there are parts interacting between me and my sister for instance which i need to very consciously and carefully avoid or speak around otherwise we will get under each other's skin and snap

sally paper example shows the poor me mannerism acted out, how when a personality part starts talking or acting, there is serious consequence to even small actions and ticks

maybe biden blah blah caveat, but generally poker players can read tells and magicians can misdirect our attention and experiments and careful questioning can reveal a mind in how a body moves through a minute, in general with some probability more than a coin flip
in therapy maybe a couple dead ends just coincidence so can't be so certain with first impression but even a couple data points together can inform a model very well and it's worthwhile to pull on habits and little mannerisms and gestures, zen calm buddha master can actually have greater command of faculties, but like scale ai, small delta big difference 94 to 96% quality or 98-99

the theory is like any engineering theory or mathematical proof of an algorithm. dating problem i recently explained to some ecuadorian friends, what did you study? solution of ~37% threshold, with 37% confidence for best result, and they were like, "what oh i though math meant like calculous or something" to each other. i grabbed the conversation back, there is calculus, you have to sum an infinite series to get 1/e and in the limit it's an integral so yea deep theory nuances get us the actual result, and without it, there's nothing, no proof, no confidence, no result, no bridge to stand on, and you're stuck on one shore or the other, one planet or the other, it's really night and day

pg 24 quote "without a fuller appreciation" paragraph from pdf

how does this fit in with psychodynamic and cbt, cbt is intervention ok, what's this other jungian thing?

implications for companies too, and the need for 1:1 meetings and explorations, since motivated free market laborers esp in information economy like my role or pm etc when motivated can push to greater nuance and better ideas and results, shipped creatively etc smallest viable audience. seth godin talks a lot about internal struggles at the individual level, as well as the overall system of the economy, technological progress, reaching the masses with culture-changing products and self-actualizing at the same time

management by drucker
discipline that's clearly just as important as having underlying technologies to be able to use and implement them with robust systems, governments and banks and basic services in ecuador are weird sometimes. people don't think from fully considered lens, and they get stuck in their environment not realizing the knowledge is out there, and it's a whole world of difference with lot of practical implications. coding boot camp totally possible but construction worker won't do it.

shifting to learning mindset jim collins article, great question for myself...just now starting to systematically really disable some limiting assumptions and beliefs, suddenly open to psychedelics for example.

"i hate you" quote leading to relationship fragmentation totally happened with me and sam van cise and others. just wholesale removal, part for whole synechdoche

learning iii description sounds like kant or some moral human inner spirit which is pure and holy. my self is super tied up with analytical intellectualizing, not compassion, very distant.
this explains why scared to do things because emotions are not part of the picture, and some situations like talking with women becomes a fraught experience without self compassion to rely on, and saying the right thing overwhelms my computation engine in a way that work or other activities like chess do not. at home in cerebral zones. not dancing or skinny dipping or real human connection. ok superficial like initial impression and chitchat, and also that's why empathetic training and conversation microskill framework from libby was so impactful for me.

really sad how few people are able to take this next step, especially those from material resources who could but just don't have a desire to. i could have easily avoided this for my whole life, it's a big can of worms and probably an endless whole of quality improvement. differentiates generational healing and wholesome families vs those which increasingly break down or have kids unable to return home, not that there isn't love but that it isn't channeled and studied and human realtions aren't systematized in a way that respects the family unit and the individuals' complexity and multi-stakeholder nature/values.

i don't even want to call my aunt lai household because there are too many dysfunctions i want to fix, intellectual part, so i need to deprogram that but also would be great if they could adopt some of this language to heal themselves and work on improving instead of living there, so sad, 20 years of child rearing and inadequacy just going on and on and on. like love in the time of cholera. the human condition i guess. i didn't do well in writing stories for junot diaz, very 1 dimensional and plot driven.

how far away am i from being centered? pretty far i think, hopefully good enough at navigating to get gains over next couple months. identifying parts, expressing compassion, not allowing them to take over without permission. rationality is heavily ruling over emotionality.

steps
-> envision parts
-> give compassion
-> examine parts
-> work with them regularly to reinforce compassion, build trust
-> disentangle
-> live centered
-> constantly reduce polarization, increase happy family advising and love and stillness

touching on human condition wow



put link to part 2 at part 1 bottom, remove top edit.
good start, reflected and refined significantly with better resources, in part 2



journey to elevate the self is adult phd i was looking for when i didn't want to go to school and didn't have a coherent unifying vision for my life. now i see it is to explore this self-discovery seriously and become a lifelong student as well as perhaps a teacher...people said my previous blog post resonated, and i hope to create content that is instructive to solving a wide variety of problems individually and maybe at a larger level, within my unique perspective and sphere of influence. yup and coming can be thought of as very initial stages, what's the actual change seeking to make and how can it be made more effectively, really just showcasing smart awesome people not helping the customer of choice...let's ask that question more seriously, like failed to do with LOM. and same mentality for chess curriculum project.

inner system equilibrium being pulled out of whack activates some strong reactions perhaps, hmmm, sounds like Reiman's dark night of the soul.

wendy fear protected by anger, controlling, accept dave jenny from lack of safety traumaic world shock, normal to be mean, struggle.

prompt:
- sit with parts, havie compassion, explore trouble understanding and seeing
- parts being shamed, parts protecting why dones't like act unreasonably?
