June was a strange month, during a strange year, and now I'm writing and reflecting on a strange day. It's probably the least patriotic and least celebratory Independence Day that I've experienced in my life, nationally and personally.

Part of the strangeness is the virtual-social vacuum. The sensation that as I hit my first year mark of working in San Francisco, I no longer have any serious ties to this place, no real reason to live where I do. I frequent the amazing [Good Mong Kok dim sum Bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/good-mong-kok-bakery-san-francisco), occassionally go into my company's office, and on rare occassions see a friend, but mostly, I'm just holed up in my apartment. Staring at the world through Retina display.  

I'm fortunate and grateful my pandemic lifestyle and accompanying logistical puzzles don't pose huge obstacles. If anything, I've gained flexibility. I've done things I probably wouldn't have otherwise done&mdash;good things, like [working out more regularly](https://abswithjenny.bubbleapps.io/), [publishing an article](https://en.chessbase.com/post/learning-chess-the-easy-way), and [donating](/giving-what-we-can).

But the larger part of the strangeness is
relationship socio-political
city and local and national and how do I fit into the narratives and the world
macroeconomic trends, peter thiel and the slowdown of science
how this relates to black lives matter

difficult to even talk about

Black Lives Matter (and hiding)
https://blog.readme.com/black-lives-matter/

I have a few confessions to make.

Reading it doesn’t have to be crazy at work. Reflecting on company culture and how I would want to grow this abs project into an org. Why aren’t more people aligned towards this north star of many obviously correct things? Maybe it’s something like the following…

Most people don’t have enough energy / focus / neurosis to care. Most people don’t have enough work experience to make the right call. And those who do make the call often don’t have enough life experience to be correctly confident / emotionally intelligent about self-revision or continuous evolution at a good empathetic pace. Often over or under-confident so they won’t listen or won’t state in first place or give their theory long enough tenure to take hold and show results.

Also, there’s the systems aspect where culture requires effort and nurturing and tilling the soil, which is always under-valued in work place given ambitions and market pressures and culture and adult legacy OS, and America. What Jason said in the book around feed your culture and dissect your process.

Usually you’re waiting for spots to open up, and the powers that be to grant you movement into open spots. It’s nothing about ability etc. All about legacy. This is compounded by lower pie growth rate.

Scale and field eng lead vs ReadMe and head of support. Once some folks told me to think about where I’d like to end up, but I chose to say “I’m here for whatever’s best for the business” and I let my manager tell me what he wanted. In the other, I was not told by anybody and I said “I want to go here, here’s how I can contribute, and here’s why I’m the best choice for you and the business and you won’t find anything better in the world, make it a yes.”

Mentality of a junior vs maturity of a manager.



BLM george floyd protest thoughts...

Why rachel katz and others cry and are emotionally down…the oppressive weight of history and futility...you have to support the cause, but you’re tired of supporting the cause when it makes such little or slow progress. It’s an emotional, personal reaction to want to quit. Just like how I quit from e3 Civic High, or any of my previous jobs. But on a much grander scale, with much larger ramifications, and with much deeper emotional burden to the individual and society. Wow.

I was at first surprised and a bit like “why would we allow this distracting crap into the workplace” …. Like “aren’t there more important things if we’re going to try to futily change society, why can’t we actionably change our bug handling process”
But that’s not a very human perspective, the human perspective would be “oh, this person across from me is processing the state of the world, and they are feeling in this moment very vulnerable, or not secure, or not equipped to be present for these other set of activities and emotional labor. I’ve been there too, had many rough days, sometimes consecuritvely or for an entire year post-college. And I was lucky enough to have the power to change my external circumstances to suit my will and mood, without real consequence, in fact with mostly benefit. I could process on my feet. Other people have to sit still, to wallow and bathe in it. Much more profoundly challenging. So I should give them space, the benefit of the doubt, and ask what I can do to help them shoulder the burden, and help out and make extra extra emotional breathing room.

Also -- my post on deepening oneself and being positive sum player by enhancing diversity and doing you and writing tips...is very much a metaphor about racism, changing the culture, making a stance, and crafting an ethical life, lived with passion and practicality. I didn’t realize this until seeing bunch of resources (Shinae article, jimmy fallon interview naacp and other dude, etc)
