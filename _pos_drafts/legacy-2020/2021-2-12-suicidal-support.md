title: Supporting The Suicidal
date: 2021-2-12

Someone close to me&mdash;let's call them Sam&mdash;reached out while confronting a difficult situation. Sam's friend Jane had been hospitalized with high risk of self-harm.

Jane needed serious help both in and out of the hospital, including delivery of personal items like clothing, an eventual ride back home from this hour-plus distant facility, and seemingly lots of social and emotional support.

Jane opposed any family involvement whatsoever, and as a young adult in a relatively new city, she had zero other people to call on. As the primary support-giver, Sam suddenly had to manage this situation on top of a strenuous Tuesday workload.

Sam was still catching up at work after a few sick days due to a bad case of strep throat last week. The job was a career-defining new role in a new company, and on top of everything else, there were other pre-existing commitments filling Sam's spare time.

The core issue that led to our late-night call wasn't necessarily the logistics, but more so the feeling of complete overwhelm. Sam knew he had to help Jane as much as possible&mdash;it was clearly priority number one&mdash;but although he desperately wanted to, he was struggling to figure out how.

Sam didn't like going to the hospital. It was a long drive, and the demands on his time felt both very sudden and completely open-ended. He was guilty about his annoyed reaction and burdened with so many questions that he broke down in tears.

When should he say what? Where was the rest of the world, or at least family and other friends? What to do next? How could he support Jane most effectively during this time of need?

Sam thought that he couldn't discuss certain topics and didn't know how to set proper boundaries for his role as a supportive friend. He thought that he had to be the one helping with everything since Jane explicitly requested Sam and didn't want anyone else. He feared inadvertently causing sadness or otherwise hurting Jane.

I knew Sam's intentions were perfectly good, but I could also see that his approach might create serious issues. However, I had a hard time finding the right framing to show Sam the problems and solutions I saw. The conversation became heated, tense with misunderstanding and defensiveness.

Then, we had a breakthrough moment when I landed on an analogy that clicked everything into place. I've written this post to share the analogy because it seems quite useful.

Imagine taking care of someone who has a painful throat issue. She also has a fever, and possibly a bunch of other symptoms that neither of you are able to detect well. She has trouble speaking and can't get out of bed. She's stuck in your house, in your bed, and you're afraid to leave her alone in order to get help or continue living your life.

You're standing there, near the kitchen, wondering what you should do. Of course you're going to consult the first 17 pages of Google results, and call all the medical experts in the country, and so much more. You've probably done some of this already, and told your mom about it.

Then the patient, your close friend, feebly gestures with a small twitch of her index finger. You squeeze the other hand, stare into her eyes with all your might, and tear yourself away.

You boil some water for lemon ginger tea and a hot compress, checking the ice packs as well. You heat a pot of chicken noodle soup. She must have been pointing towards her mouth for water...but maybe it was a request to visit the bathroom? You shudder to think at how sick she might be.

You bring over the soup, then run to fetch an eyedropper. Ever so gingerly, like you're feeding a baby cat, you place the stew onto her tongue. You watch, observing everything, stressed about what her closed eyes and grimacing swallow entail. It's a fraught, guesswork-filled moment.

You take the slight nod as a signal to proceed with more, pouring gently from a glass because you couldn't find a straw. You need to make sure she's getting what she needs without hurting her more, and the soup is hot.

After a couple hours (days) of this ministering, you have to accept that the throat pain is out of your control. It dwarfs any possible sensation you will cause with your genuine efforts. Your tiptoe-peacekeeping mentality becomes problematic; it's more self-comfort oriented than truly helpful.

You need to verify, "Can you walk? Can you talk? Tell me how you're feeling. What is your condition, this sickness?"

You can make this discussion as overly-communicative as you like: "I'm concerned I'll hurt you by what I'm doing, and by talking I don't want to bring you discomfort, but I'm now drip-dropping soup for hours here and I'm honestly feeling overwhelmed. May we please, somehow&mdash;and it doesn't have to be this moment&mdash;have the conversation about how I can give you soup more sustainably? I don't mean to diminish your sickness, and I sincerely hope I don't cause you any pain, but I hope your sore throat can speak to me even just a little bit. I'll wait; thanks for your courage and trust in sharing directly and honestly what's going on with you."

To deal with suicidal thoughts, it's possible to [learn how to help](https://samaritanshope.org/get-help/how-to-help/), for example with [QPR techniques](https://qprinstitute.com/about-qpr) and [risk assessment methods](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/mental-health/practice-and-service-quality/safety/suicide-prevention-in-mental-health-services/suicide-risk-assessment), but the essential question is very simply: "Are you thinking of killing yourself?"

You have to be prepared to ask this directly. You have to talk about the situation, as [difficult](https://play.acast.com/s/akimbo/difficultconversations) as it may be.

The soup feeding and conversation are perhaps momentarily discomforting, but they are orthogonal to the underlying sickness and won't greatly exacerbate it. These are necessary and helpful measures to fight the good fight together, as a team. In the unlikely event that there is some resultant problem, then you need to find out why right away and follow up (surfacing issues is progress).

Don't be pushy of course. Steer toward the pain, gently, to try understanding what's going on and what can be done. You're on the other person's team. You need to know more about their capabilities, their physical and mental state as a teammate, and what they want to do.

It helps to be cognizant of how you approach The Hurricane:

<br>Your friend will not be committing suicide in the next two minutes while you are patiently conversing. It's unlikely they will be mad or sad with you at all, especially if you can just be curious together about the situation. They will mull over your questions and assertions for the next hour, and they will eventually conclude that you are a true friend.

A true friend is willing to provide the ultimate support of performing hard emotional labor on behalf of another, to initiate communication and get through to them in a time of darkness.

Your friend with the sore throat or the suicidal thoughts will appreciate your non-judgmental listening and desire to partner in a way that's sustainable for both of you&mdash;perhaps over the course of hours, months, or decades.

Things will get better with patience, and one day they will say to you, "Wow...thanks. I really appreciate your leadership and friendship. That supportive, direct communication saved my life."
