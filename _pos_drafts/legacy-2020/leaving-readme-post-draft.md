My experiences are bouncing off

Having worked in a serious capacity for some great, interesting companies


 For now, I'll simply say that


 but for now I'll conclude with

Projects, evaluating with value creation + capture
Value as in both externalities and personal learning and growth
Capture is obvious, revenue to pay the bills and put food on the table
biggest burn is rent, so moving somewhere cheaper
Happy to talk more about this to anyone interested, but also will be keeping my head down and grinding for a bit
Also eyes open for special opportunities, open to full-time but likely taking a few months to work independently

Along with life transition are some thoughts on identity, personal and professional, as well as what it takes to succeed, however one defines it. There will be an intrinsic need for sustainability, playing the infinite game.

## Couple frameworks

Zach Rivkin
Skills
Capital access
Connections / network / relationships
Pre-requisites, ideas and goal underemphasized. Doesnâ€™t break down motivation or skill clearly.

Catherine on Warren Buffet
Intelligence
energy
Integrity
Character traits. Assumes assets come after these fundamentals, like people liking you and capital from Warren.



## My framework

My list
Dissatisfaction: to have a constant kick in the pants, spurring you to forward motion. Drive. Extreme optimism that things could be much better!
Target / Goals / Strategy: clear place to move towards, north star, and intermediates to get started.
Tactical rigor, ruthless prioritization, meticulous execution: speed and efficiency, risk minimization, ability to get shit done.
Self-confidence: knowledge that everything is solvable and that you are able to push through, self-fulfilling prophecy. Gets us through the lows and keeps us focused on what matters during the highs, not side-tracked by the crowd.
Humility / open-mindedness: flexible, hungry and curious for mid-course corrections.
(optionally required) Thoughtfulness: aiming at good, converging to universal truth and infinite game mindset.
Masculine ideals, object-oriented.
