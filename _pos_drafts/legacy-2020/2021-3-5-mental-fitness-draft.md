It's been raining a lot in Loja.

We made great progress last week scooping out a driveway, but the machine does more damage than work in the mud. My builder decided to pause construction.

Once things dry up a bit, we'll level the corner to make a broader, smoother entry. Then comes an important finishing touch: gravel.

The raw, wet dirt has already claimed a couple of the neighbors' cars. They've been asking how long until the road is usable again?

My builder says it's up to nature, and refuses to do anything but the best work in the best conditions. I got impatient and asked one of the upset neighbors to finish the job.

His choice excavator wanted to wait for dryer conditions too. Same as my builder, but lower quality and higher cost. So much for my brilliant idea to rush things.

I lost many hours fretting over a situation outside of my control. I hired then fired my neighbor and created needless friction with my builder.

I sought to please people through hurried action when stillness and some thoughtful words would have sufficed.

The cabin design is coming together nicely. We'll pick out appliances next week. Once the weather improves, the driveway will be finished as originally planned. Foundations can then be laid.

Overall, the pace of progress is three steps forward and one step back. I'm happy to be learning as we go, and I'll probably enjoy the house that much more in the end.
