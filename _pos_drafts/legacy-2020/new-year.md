New year, new blog.
Well I guess it's the same.
Landing page, about page, search bar, stars went away. (gif of this?)
influences (revise and post about this), books soon, visit me soon

interesting how only after 121 + 17 posts, I am finding some shape and structure and purpose in the blog. subscriber count is growing, and people have reached out from all over the world.
write write write says Seth. I didn't get it, but I did it, and He's right.
I don't want to publish as many life updates or think of the blog that way, even though that's what the audience demands. They like personal stories not abstract concepts. So I can do that, it will be good just like with the book.

What's coming up in the next year??

- how I'm feeling now

listicles!
10 mistakes
10 grateful things
10 amazing incredible things
10 crazy weird things

maybe 20 positive (intersting), 20 negative (interesting), 20 ordinary (covid, etc), 20 personal

- personal reflections on 2020

- goals for 2021 and the future
