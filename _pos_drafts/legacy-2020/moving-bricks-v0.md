Have you ever known what it's like to move a large pile of bricks uphill on a dirt road in the rainy season with a wheelbarrow?

These aren't dainty little colonial bricks either. These are homemade monsters, each heavier than a bowling ball, compact and cracking. Their rough edges mutually erode in the cart as it tumbles over stones and valleys in the dirt, each magnified by the weight of the single squeaking wheel.

On the first try, you think 10 bricks will make a decent starting run. You contemplate 15, but decide 10 is a manageable load to get the hang of it. You stop many times&mdash;every few feet a body-lurching battle that demands a reprieve&mdash;and from then on you will load no more than 8.

You learn to keep the cart low, all your forward and upward momentum angled directly against the hill's incline. You learn to move forward on your tiptoes, a slow-motion sprint, calf muscles bulging and straining as you pant to oxygenate each laborious step forward.

You learn to pile the bricks at the front of the wheelbarrow. Althought it is less than a quarter full, it feels like a drum&mdash;no a dumptruck&mdash;full of water. Balancing the load over the wheel makes your job slightly easier. You shift your hands all the way up the handlebars to get a firm purchase, sacrificing leverage for security and maximum stability as you lean in and up.

You learn to orient the wheelbarrow uphill before you load in the bricks because pivoting 180 degrees with a full cart is asking for trouble. You might tire yourself out before you even hit the difficult divots, which frequently stop you dead in your tracks. Any more exertion to push through them will make your arms fall off. And of course this is the most pebble-strewn area, where the gravel gives way under your biting toes. You fear smacking your chin on the rusty edge hanging under you&mdash;it's a horrible reverse guillotine which you will surely, painfully, survive.

You have to do this. It is your task for the morning. If it isn't done quickly, the sun will scorch your path and make the job even more tiresome. If it isn't done heavily, the lighter loads will never end, and 4 or even 6 bricks are almost as tiresome as 8.

A gulp of water. Gloves, hiking boots. All good decisions. Extra grip on the ground and handles.

The wheel. The axel is noisy. What if we grease it?

But no, there is enough weight that the oil will surely be pressed out. No, the metal is already worn smooth. The cart moves just fine when it's empty, downhill. The wheel is not the issue here.

Grub. Uncovered, huge, pulsing slowly as it winds its way back into the earth. Bigger than a giant grasshopper. Maybe it is a giant grasshopper, before it metamorphosizes. Oddly, you feel some kinship with the creature, blindly groping the earth, shying away from the sudden sunlight. You cover it with a brick chip. You know what it's like to face discomfort, and you know you couldn't do it without a full night's sleep either.

Back to pushing.

Push your body, push the cart. Up the slope. Focus on form, stride by stride. Tense elbows bent, ready for dips. Breathe level and easy, mind moving forward. Embrace it; power through.

It's almost as if the bricks don't matter at all.
