Letter to AA:

Dear American Airlines,

Prior to boarding my recent flight, I had an extremely unpleasant experience with the Asian lady who gate-checked the bags for this flight, then the supervisor she escalated to, Azarael Pillay (https://www.linkedin.com/in/azarael-pillay-051410141).

I have published a blog post describing the issue here: https://andytrattner.com/luggage-restrictions.

This reflects poorly on management, and AA as a company. I don't know the exact people responsible, but I would guess some folks like Robert Mok (https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-mok-41a630120) and Marvin Turpin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marvin-turpin-376b7247) would be relevant.

I strongly recommend implementing consistent policies to enforce luggage size restrictions. This means either: make sure every bag fits in the little container thing, or let folks pass if their bag obviously and historically fits just fine into the overhead bin.

Perhaps more importantly, it's in your interests to train and empower your senior employees with 5+ years of experience to make the correct decisions in the field when dealing with upset customers, and to communicate with them kindly. As I mention in the blog post, I have flown on AA multiple times this year, but I now plan to reduce this significantly (possibly to zero), so you have now lost thousands of dollars of future revenue over a silly $40 fee.

Best,
Andy
