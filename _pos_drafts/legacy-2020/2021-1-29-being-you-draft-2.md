Recently I've been enjoying the [online board game Diplomacy](https://www.backstabbr.com/) with a few non-overlapping friend groups (thanks Nick for getting me hooked)! Some folks met for the first time during a video hangout I hosted last weekend.

The conversation turned to one particular friend who explained his current job. Others asked follow-up questions, so we spent a few minutes learning about the work.

I accidentally injected some dramatic irony as the topic came to a close, subverting the entire conversation with insider knowledge: "And how goes the search for a new job?"

He tactfully transitioned away from further discussion, saying it was still early. His new acquaintances were spared from the messy personal details, and we moved on.

A few years ago, I might have been frustrated observing this interaction. And if I were in my friend's position, I would not have handled any of it so gracefully. My response to "what do you do?" would have been a long meandering "I do this now but I want to do this and that soon, previously I was doing another thing, oh and I'm also drawn to..."

Family, friends, and potential employers were frequently perplexed by my existential confusion. I lacked a coherent professional narrative; I was naively and unsuccessfully trying to present myself fully, honestly.

I was very lucky to land a full-time role in customer operations at [Scale AI](https://scale.com) after two failed tries with other teams. One of my managers eventually shared some valuable feedback by poking fun at me one day after we established great rapport.

Apparently, he was initially against hiring me because I had completely bombed the interview question about my recent work. I foolishly included driving Uber in my laundry list of odd jobs, then proceeded to talk about inane details when asked to explain customer service lessons learned (hint: don't ramble about braking more smoothly and not initiating conversations with headphone-wearing passengers).

Because I didn't speak at the right level of abstraction to nail the question, my poor interviewers were bamboozled. Why they were considering hiring me as a customer engineer for large, highly sophistocated machine learning accounts?

I soon learned to shut my trap and say one clear sentence when one sentence would serve.

Now I deeply appreciate my friend's professional tact in not dumping his life story and current complications on a group of first-time board game acquaintances.

However, I still have this drive to be overly-honest, to represent my internal state as faithfully as I can when asked&mdash;despite its indigestible, horribly nonlinear incoherence.

This impulse drives my blogging, both at the macro level and the micro. While drafting this post, I wrote hundreds more words than the (admittedly long) final version, just vomiting all my thoughts by closing my eyes and typing typing until my brain ran out of juice. Then I applied my newfound professional eye to chopp, reformat, and parse the craziness.

This supervisory mindset took a couple years to adopt, and it's definitely a work in progress. I'm really only beginning to present a coherent identity to the world and get my story straight.

A big challenge is that my narrative happens to fall far outside the norm. I'm currently settling into a cheap life in Ecuador for maximal runway + isolated space for reflective deep work. I'm blogging and writing and doing personal projects in the hopes of one day having sustainable creative self-employment.

It took significant emotional labor to become comfortable with this working identity. I've had to fight against a deeply internalized mainstream narrative that taking more than a few months to be funemployed is a very bad idea&mdash;professionally, financially, socially, etc. And for whatever reason, the acceptable alternative is trying to start a high-growth, venture-funded tech company.

My conclusion is most folks don't realize that even if I fail at content creation, and have $0 in the bank, I'll at least have a powerful story to tell others. Unlike last time I tried striking out on my own, when I went to San Diego and drove Uber, this time I have concrete projects. I'm keeping myself accountable. I act with the understanding that "if it doesn't [ship](https://alexarohn.com/shipping-for-the-uninitiated/), then [it doesn't count.](https://seths.blog/2020/08/shipping-creative-work/)"

Moreover, because of this approach, I can't really fail. I am shipping content, however good or bad, and it's valuable in itself to do so. Being enmeshed in the process fosters in-depth experiences I will forever bring with me. Creative work furthers my identity. I'm proud to take an idea and shepard it into the world as a finished product.

In terms of the mainstream narrative, there's also career capital accumulating. The failed company founder might be a great employee or investor because they learned so much in going out on a limb and living (what seems from the outside like) an enormous risk.

I don't believe my path is for everyone. I value autonomy and self-expression far above income. In fact, it's very rare to meet someone who is as extreme as I am in this regard.

So how surprising last week to meet a kindred spirit in [Reiman Bledsoe](https://linktr.ee/reiman) (Simon with an "R"), [Mr. Survivor 2015](https://rhap.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Bledsoe), whom my sister happened to be [watching on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70153367) as we were traipsing around Loja together.

Reiman used to be a derivatives trader at Belvedere but now he has a podcast, [Redeeming Disorder](https://open.spotify.com/show/2cBsvpKQG9evKHUbpAoUo2), and he's working on other creative endeavors when he's not meditating or [doing celebrity things](https://www.cameo.com/spencerbledsoe). As former chess players of roughly equal skill level, we discovered a mutual friend and bonded on a number of levels. He carves his own path and values adventure, which we both see as an expression of autonomy&mdash;using our freedom to the fullest.

Other friends are acting this out to varying degrees in their careers, some more traditional than others. We're all somewhere along the neverending journey to become more of ourselves. The way we get there is often to [to trust ourselves more](http://trustyourself.com/).
