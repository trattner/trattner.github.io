title: Succeeding at Being You
date: 2021-1-29

I had a call with some friends last week who didn't know each other
of course they asked what kind of work they were involved with
one was describing his job, and others found it interesting or were being polite with questions for more details
as he went on and came to an end, I jumped in
and how goes the search for a new job?
these other folks didn't know him as well and only got the current schpiel, professional identity
I wanted the on-the-ground version, the messy complexities, the real story
the audience was split, and still early he said, a nice simple way to move on to other topics with the group, tactfully

when I was interviewing after college, I had all kinds of issues with scattered dreams and directions,
I wanted to work in education, but also wanted to make lots of money
I wanted to position myself for a career of success
I wanted to manage people
I wanted to do investments, also found a startup, write a book, be a politician, gain engineering skills, manage projects
I applied to every kind of job, quant trader to elementary school teacher to engineer and sales rep, nonprofits and research data science openings
Mostly folks could see by my responses I wasn't focused nor experienced, and my dozen previous jobs and internships were all over the map, so I was rejected
Those that I managed to sneak by who were interested by my strange background and obvious enthusiasm to turn my potential kinetic, soon found out I had trouble articulating my direction and fit. I didn't see it at the time, but wasn't rejected because of ability, it was coherent story and fit.
Scale AI eventually took a chance and hired me full time (on the third try), and my manager later told me during the interview I bombed so many questions,
they asked what I was doing recently and I said driving uber, hiding their surprise, they asked what I learned from that and instead of talking about serving customers I talked about how to brake more smoothly and not talk to the people with headphones on, obvious and off-topic things that didn't really hit the ball out of the park which I was lobbed
I only got the job on the strength of my hustle, analytical skills, empathy...but really none of those, it was all the recommendations of a couple early employees who were college friends and the desperation of the growing company to find people who could learn on the fly and put in serious work
all this to say, I soon learned to shut my trap and say one clear sentence when one sentence would serve, but still inside I have this drive to be honest and say what's top of mind and be true to my internal state and represent it as faithfully as I can when asked.
and the internal state is complex. often horribly nonlinear and noncohesive
so this blog post draft is hundreds more words than the final, just vomiting all my thoughts closing eyes and typing typing until my brain runs out of juice
then reformatted and put together and parsed with my new professional eye
it took a couple years, and definitely work in progress I'm just beginning really to present a coherent identity to the world and get my story straight
but I don't think a single job or company can mesh fully with such a ball of personality, I have trouble settling into a role and haven't been able to stay in one spot for more than half a year once onboarding learning dies down and the daily grind long-term sitting with the role and company function begins... I tend to go sideways and want to re-think the whole company from the ground up, especially when sitting in the customer-facing market bridge role absorbing data that's not as evident to product / eng, HR, and other orgs...

so here I am, working on building myself a cheap life in Ecuador for maximal runway and isolation and reflection time
blogging and writing and doing personal projects to hopefully one day make myself a self-employed career
for now I'm sustained by some savings and my resume, which I now know how to speak about coherently and think I can get a job if I want to commit to a career
but for now I'm rolling with my slow burn investing in living with myself and hopefully contributing some unique works to the market / world like my book

what most folks don't realize I think is that even if I fail, and have $0 in the bank, I'll at least have a true true story to tell others. Unlike last time when I went to san diego and drove uber and didn't really act, this time I have concrete projects: building a house, writing - publishing - selling books, soon something more... I'm keeping myself accountable to a degree and shipping real stuff

it furthers my identity, creative work
it is detailed and I can point to real in-depth experience I will forever remember, even if the book only sells half a dozen copies or none, even if no one reads this blog, I am proud of the finished product because I emotionally labored to ship it
and failed company founders are often good employees because they understand end to end business. spaceX employee, tech HR lead from car dealership owner, support lead from restaurant manager
better to succeed at being me even if it runs me to the ground, or better maybe even fail trying and go back to the mainstream to predefined roles where I do what other people tell me, than to never really try and to let social pressures and available jobs dictate my actions and career
it may work for some people, especially those who have certain goals like starting a family and they want to save or make money at a high rate with highest probability
but for me the value system is autonomy and self-expression and self-actualization
the more I can create original self works, (the more I can emulate seth godin)
the more I can push myself and iterate and learn what it means to be me and to create what I am uniquely positioned to create, in the long term that's where career should head for anyone, and hopefully I am jump starting

so if I can hang in there for a year or two at being me and working really working at myself and projects, that's the most valuable resume item possible, both for my self=actualization and future employers
because it is honest and I can bring full passion and enthusiasm and understanding
and constitutionally better than any job I can do where my heart isn't in it to be that job and hold it for a few years, long term just don't have motivation to do it, don't see it as an investment but rather as a depreciating asset

Reiman bledsoe was really inspiring last weekend we hung out
he's from survivor, met from Maya airbnb

Reiman is a Uchicago grad who used to work at belvedere trading
https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/spencer-bledsoe-a2756628
now has podcast, does meditation, celebrity things, netflix wendy was mad
https://linktr.ee/reiman
mr. survivor 2015 https://rhap.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Bledsoe
https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Bledsoe
chess player roughly equal skill level like myself
regular spiritual and meditative retreats, likes adventure which we both see as expression of autonomy freedom, using it to the fullest

he's also doing what he needs to carve his own path
has podcast, writing a book
i have a book, working on podcast
funny we resonated a lot

some friends are doing so to varying degrees in their careers
some are looking to do so in their careers
we're all somewhere in the neverending journey to become more of ourselves and share more authentically with the world and create value
asked some friends who are all starting various companies vahid yasyf tiger
https://vahid.io/
https://www.yasyf.com/
http://tigerthinks.com/

they didn't really get the thing cuz i didn't phrase correctly
basically some folks create value directly, don't worry too much about identity stuff, identy is the project, and project is solving a specific commercial problem
I'm a little bit not able to solve a specific commercial problem,
i'm preoccupied with solving the problem of who is andy and this is coming out in creative art which i find value making in itself and over time iterate towards the art being more valuable when others share in it
either approach is fine, for me this one feels correct

it is a little weird, like Jim Carrey doing painting but without being Jim Carrey...
retirement early...
but really don't see objection, mainly just the annoying question--
which expresses the value system of needing money and career as an asset
I propose substituting my own career here is the best possible asset
and base this on some past experience...
nontraditional paths are good. just be yourself!!
it's ok to wander around, i'm sure examples will bear me out
for example sipser told me i'm like this comedian who failed...now he's cto...so in that framework success...
but really mostly just based on my own experience, and that's what ultimately being an adult and independent thinker is about, knowing when to trust yourself, bet on yourself, and engage in the practice http://trustyourself.com/

How will you get a job after months or years without one?

This reminds me of a similar question I asked myself at age 17, going into senior year of high school: how will I get into a good college if I don't go to school?

I'm not going to class to learn about x subject so I can major in x subject and become a professor in x subject.

I'm not going to work to gain experience in x job so I can become a manager in x job and be the consumate guy in x job.

I'm rather gaining life and personal deepening. Exploring a bit, so that I can better take on x job or subject when the right one comes along, with more perspective and deep understanding of context.

It's not about jumping through hoops and landing in an ever-smaller one, as the specialization shoves forward. It's more about carving a unique story outside of others' definitions, providing unique value and setting my own proposition. Saying my time is infinitely more valuable than your x dollars per hour or your presecripted degree program.

sure, being lazy and there are days when I'm for sure lazy, these things are waste of time and there's nothing to show. But working on a project, building a body of work, taking initiative to set and achieve self-definited goals whatever they are, this creates a story. One that is compelling and granular. Selling book, growing blog, building house, doing stuff...

I'm lucky that I already checked some career boxes, enough so that I'm confident I can go back and work. Not many people have been promoted 3 times in less than a year and managed multi-million dollar relationships / accounts / projects and sales opportunities. I closed deals. And made investments. pre-YC 100% and Interact 100%

Presidential Scholars Program and college, I took a sideways route. Yes I had the pre-requisites, by any measure I was a good student. But the differentiating factors were key, stories of challenge and struggle, stories of calculated initiative and risk, stories of rejecting the mainstream for x y z reasons and showing results. publishing a paper. building a chess club, tutoring folks, running for class president.

And when such things become fun and not so scary as amazing oppotunities, no-brainers, that's when the payoff starts. when you know it's the right choice, to grow and do this exciting stuff which is better than any job anyone could give you.

I hit a plateau in my real jobs, always around or before the 3-6 month mark. This is when you really settle in and have an idea of the job, at month 3, then you try pushing past and at month 6 you realize that you need to be patient with the world around you. before that you're changing yourself and learning and that can be engaging and fast, but then the rubber meets the road and you have to settle into your title and job description and get ready for the longer haul to crank.

I couldn't adapt to such things. I would still be pushing and moving and this isn't what your manager wants...they want someone who will do the job they need done, well. They don't want some revolutionary who wants to steer the whole company in a new direction. Someone who thinks they can do the manager's job better than they can. Someone who will upset the status quo and be re-defining everyone's jobs. Someone who's never satisfied, who's too intense, who's always growing a bit out of the box.

And so there was conflict of fit. I wanted more. I knew I was worth more. Other people didn't know how to channel that, I didn't know how to channel that. And my time and energy are priceless so there's really no end to the comp I would demand.

The only way to really do this is to own my own labor and capture the upside.
Companies are limited, specific and growth within a company can be wide-ranging but also very specific. There's a special kind of sauce that happens with patient people over longer periods and experience, OK, but that doesn't have to be the case. Plenty of world-changing folks show us that and often prove the opposite.

I don't fancy myself world-changing, but maybe I can get a smallest viable audience and that will be enough.

And if I can do that by embracing all parts of me and not just the job output, well then I have succeeded at being me. At putting forth my values through my actions, both unique, and showing results.   

first I need to be sold on myself. for me, that's easy I've been pretty sold since third grade reading under my desk and not listening to the boring slow teacher. Even more sold as a junior in high school and capping out with non-calculus physics saying don't do both physics C AP at once, then I got a 5 and said why am I learning from you. And I got enough feedback from peers etc. pleasant surprise most likely to succeed

identity not very strong at beginning, group belonging, etc.
linked to institutions and others
then eventually realize unique mishmash and go

Success is different for everyone, but mainstream narrative has money, power, happiness, needs being met and life being lived fully. Identity being firm, often aspirationally inclined towards awards or stats or figures. And that's how we sell ourselves to employers and such too, being impressive and fitting a story with dimensions tailored to the job. I'm the best for this job, you want to prove.

Some people have such strong brands and identities, they do things that are very them. Musicians like Dodie, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles??
Elon

====== orig prompt ======
resume and hiring after book sales, having a story and college apps etc, selling your story and building a body of work...more exciting for me to do this vs readme, proving self too smart need to do othrt things if not managing
