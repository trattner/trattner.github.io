Today Dec 17
I practiced in the morning with Maya 40 minutes of qigong, and 20 minutes sitting meditation
did my own thing including abs, back, arms
later, did 30 minute sit

during this evening sit, 7:10-40 roughly, I started with 5 minutes of instability
my legs /core were shaking, I thought from my core being tired from working out
but just before the 5 minute bell, I discovered leaning forward more, engaging my core and lower back, arching the spine a bit, naturally, allowed the shaking to subside and I was still

at this point I found myself breathing shallowly, so I focused on breathing more deeply, following the breath, expanding my body a bit more upright. moving my belly in and out slighlty forcefully gave more force to the breath, and I could hear my nostril airflow, I was focused on it and it was good

then I realized maybe this is excess motion, some time later, and I focused on trying to breathe deeply, sniffing through my nose like a straw instead of focusing on my belly, but keeping my posture upright and the belly more still. the breathing was good, healthy, normal, and more quiet.

Suddenly I realized i was so focused on breathing quietly but well that my ego had completely vanished for the moment. And as soon as I realized this, I also realized this realization was my ego inserting itself into the practice! Crap now I'm thinking about the beautiful moment and I'm thinking about thinking about it and I know I have to capture this and write it down in a blog post but I also need to focus back on the breath and try to go back to that state of peace and complete focus

in out in out and the bell struck again
15 minutes into a quiet sit that I originally denied "no I'll just go to bed and not join you thanks", and I said, oh what the heck, then we did it and less than halfway through I had an epiphany

wow. powerful.

contemplate place in the cosmos regularly (religion)
repeated practice of observing and detaching, reps of returning to focus on the breath and tune out the ego, or accept it and be still
after practicing for a bit, one sees this applies to bodily pain, to fear / knee jerk with insects, any impulsive or non-deliberate action...for me this includes playing chess on the internet, or especially that 7th one after 6 defeats and I'm already questioning my use of time, or watching anime, or slacking off from working etc.
