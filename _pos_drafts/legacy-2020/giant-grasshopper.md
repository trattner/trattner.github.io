Imagine the largest grasshopper you've ever seen. Now imagine a grasshopper gigantic enough to comfortably eat that grasshopper.

I'm not sure I could have attempted this exercise prior to visiting Ecuador.

But now I've seen a tarantula spider hanging out on the ceiling, big enough that squashing it with a hand wouldn't work, a shoe would be a risky and extremely messy proposition, and the only thing left was to try enclosing it in a giant glass jar, sliding paper, and releasing it over a cliff.

And fifteen different species of flies, bees, wasps, and imitations that go buzz, also up to the size where it can eat the size that can eat the biggest fly you've ever seen.

And today just hanging out on the road in front of my feet, I ddin't have to imagine; I just saw the giant grasshopper.

Your thumb is a good representation, from base of wrist to tip of fingernail, including the meaty muscle part that makes up a solid 2/7 of your palm.

Have you ever imagined how big a grasshopper would need to be to comfortably eat the largest grasshopper you've ever seen
I saw a giant grasshopper today.

It's enough to take one's breath away.
Speaking of which...
Encountered a book after my first 10 choices on the list were all taken from SFPL overdrive ebook.
Read Exhalation from Ted Chiang, with increasing velocity, then ripped through Stories of Your Life and Others, basis of Arrival, one of my favorite movies. This is a unique movie / book relationship. The movie was better in some ways, and the book was better. Movie was more exciting, book more wistful and like All Chiang's stories, muted more introspective black mirror. Concise and beautiful writing. Startling in its beauty like the giant grasshopper.

These new and interesting little daily encounters make life spicy and wonderful. For a while, I forgot what it feels like to be refreshed. I had most if not all the answers in the USA, at the top of the career pyramid in tech.

One of the reasons moving to Ecuador. Here in the Andes mountains, perhaps my native homeland, life strikes me as more fully lived. Maybe it's the sweeping mountain vistas, maybe it's the air, certainly it's the flora and fauna, living in Latin American, but overall I think it's just the right combination of stuff, for me, right now, especially during COVID. I'd like to have more adventures to keep things interesting, continuing to appreciate the here and now of where I'm at, and also reaching out in big and small new ways.

Reading and writing wasn't as lively before reading Chiang, now there's this whole new dimension to it. I've been influenced and inspired but kinda lost touch with the playful side of things, thinking that I had to write write write my own....but lacking balance and natural intellectual curiosity at my own pace. Too many stimuli, not enough time and space to enjoy myself.

Here, that's changed, at the end of 2020, for the better.




(maybe put Chiang into influences?)
