TODO: revise with concrete language, take away passive and thought words!!!!!


In other circumstances, I imitate the first Mario, over-analyzing everything. Certain simple tasks&mdash;like packing for a vacation, picking the right Airbnb, or even making a grocery list&mdash;sometimes beg for exhaustive analysis.


<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe style="width:100%;height:100%; position: absolute;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yluf88V1PLU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

In the above video, we see Mario attempting to complete the level using three different approaches:
- The left-most frame shows Mario waiting until an optimal path is calculated.
- The right-most frame shows Mario calculating a path that just works, so he can immediately start moving toward the goal.
- The middle frame shows Mario using [Best-first Utility-guided Search](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehc/papers/parc/ijcai-05-ws-final.pdf), which estimates a good balance between planning a decent path and hurrying to start down it.

When we put these algorithms side-by-side, it's obvious that the middle way is best. But in daily life, things aren't always so clear. It's easy to waste lots of time and energy using the other approaches, especially when we're confronted with something new or uncomfortable.

A recent example that comes to mind
For example, I recently had [some construction struggles](https://andytrattner.com/construction-strugs) when I was impatient to fix a wet dirt road [here in Ecuador](https://andytrattner.com/visit/). Instead of waiting for the sun to do its magic, I launched into a flurry of activity that ultimately set me back more than it helped. Like the third Mario, I became disappointed as my hastily-chosen course of action played out.

I've also been thinking lately
In many other circumstances, I have the opposite problem of over-analyzing
Part of me really likes being meticulous, trying to understand the nuances of every little thing
very intellectual, analytical, to the point where it doesn't serve me very well
tend to take notes and such
classroom lectures and scribbles
Anna and dating thing
Therapy and IFS download
high horsepower, speedy brain, trying to explore possibilities.
got feedback from my boss in last job, head of sales, to try slowing down and problem-solving patiently instead of analyzing and forcing best thing down everyone's throat

Then we come to the idea of iteration and how we all improve on these things over time. People come from different directions, some analytical tending towards confidence and not needing so much structure, others more action-oriented or balanced, and need to err and force self to be more analytical. instead of proposing big initiatives at work, swinging for the fences, and diving into a flurry of activity without getting buy-in from the right stakeholder for example.

I certainly tend to over-analyze things, and I also recently had an issue  and make lots of plans

Over-thinking stuff is very common, and perhaps you've experienced a time when you rushed in without the best plan

The modern world presents more opportunities than ever before to discard biases and behave rationally, at least [according to Danny Kahneman](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/daniel-kahneman-on-cutting-through-the-noise/id983795625?i=1000426129151).

My analytical brain tends to dominate. Even when leaping into action, part of me is considering multiple outcomes and constantly logging observations. "Aisle 5 is a microsecond faster than going through the bakery to get broccoli and milk next time!"

But I'm often worse than Mario; instead of reaching a great solution with all this dilligent effort, I'll seek a shortcut to bail out of the process entirely. My shopping list today is crazy long, so I'll just throw up my hands
