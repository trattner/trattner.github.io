Waking up an hour earlier every day and immediately dedicating that hour to a meaningful project (learning Chinese, writing your novel, pushups and a run, etc).

This is one of the best litmus tests for is your thing actually important enough.

If you can find a thing worth doing this for, and then actually do it for a month or more, then wow.

I'm doing it for my blog because it's important enough. Because I had a trigger in place that told me, OK I'm well below my quality bar with this cell phone hey email post and not living healthy best life and I can do better. It's worth it to me.

When you take action in such a way, it tends to compound. Eric Lander says we overestimate what we can do in 1 year but underestimate what we can do in 10 years.

You can see it (hopefully) in the work you do. I suspect most people don't actually so their efforts are more linear and don't really come back to them so meaningfully.

There are obvious math examples to founder vs employee value and maybe you're subsidized by failure but also probably just not investing as directly in the production funciton.

Jenny's 5 minute abs created six-packs. My running regularly allowed me to overcome altitude and now be acclimated and more.

Learning chess was such a series of daily game review from grandmasters and such.
