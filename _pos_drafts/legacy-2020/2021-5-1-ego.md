Recently I've noticed a slew of fake controversy bubbling up in my Google News feed, for instance [Basecamp's new policies](https://www.fastcompany.com/90629977/basecamp-banned-social-and-political-conversations-at-work-heres-what-it-should-have-done) (and [Elon Musk hosting SNL](https://pagesix.com/2021/04/30/snl-cast-wont-be-forced-to-appear-with-host-elon-musk/)<!-- , which I will only giggle about  // but that's not worth commenting on, except giggles the cast and viewers of _Iron Man 2_ didn't seem to have issues.-->).

Fast Company's article on Basecamp is incredible. Nothing in Jason's [original post](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5) "banned the idea of social good." And although the swift correction of value misalignment via [employee exodus](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412714/basecamp-employees-memo-policy-hansson-fried-controversy) might be painful in the short run, it seems the bigger picture here is simply one of [good management](https://www.inc.com/david-burkus/why-amazon-bought-into-zappos-pay-to-quit-policy.html).

Basecamp is a company which Jason explicitly treats as a product, and he's making a Randian statement about what's important in the process of building it. He bets that their software will create much more impact in the long run than any political quibbling, and goes all-in.

Adam Fetcher's Fast Company article ridiculously states Basecamp "will eliminate any efforts to create value for stakeholders above and beyond the bottom line." This sentence hilariously uses economics-y words to disregards all the additional [economic surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus) that Jason correctly evaluates his company will generate from recaptured focus "compressing X to allow for expansion in Y." As a customer, I am very directly served by Basecamp's additional efforts to build the [best email software ever](/hey), so I selfishly support his choice.<!--the whole thing is really only one choice: RAND ftw!!!!-->




My favorite part of Marc Andreessen's article ["It's Time To Build"](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/), where he addresses anticipated critics:

>_Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There’s an excellent chance I’ll agree with you._








In [part 1 of this blog post](/anthem), I riffed on the novelette [_Anthem_](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1250) to conclude Rand's objectivist framework renders harsh judgments. Her ardent capitalist acolytes might therefore seem provocative or even derisive in their expressed priorities.

We didn't get to my favorite part of Marc Andreessen's article ["It's Time To Build"](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/), where he addresses anticipated critics:

>_Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There’s an excellent chance I’ll agree with you._

This is clearly provocative, but intentionally non-derisive. So let me step in and provide some scornful political commentary (which isnt really political its just objective haha)


In the spirit of  

Squarely falling into Andreessen's dreaded category of useless idea attacks are a slew of recent articles, for instance on [Basecamp's new policies](https://www.fastcompany.com/90629977/basecamp-banned-social-and-political-conversations-at-work-heres-what-it-should-have-done). (And [Elon Musk hosting SNL](https://pagesix.com/2021/04/30/snl-cast-wont-be-forced-to-appear-with-host-elon-musk/) but that's not even worth commenting on, except with giggles. The cast and viewers of _Iron Man 2_ didn't seem to have issues.)

The Fast Company article on Basecamp is incredible. Nothing in Jason's [original post](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5) "banned the idea of 'social good' entirely." And although the swift correction of value misalignment via [employee exodus](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412714/basecamp-employees-memo-policy-hansson-fried-controversy) might be painful in the short run, it seems the bigger picture here is simply one of [good management](https://www.inc.com/david-burkus/why-amazon-bought-into-zappos-pay-to-quit-policy.html).

Moreover, generously buying out employee [non-owners](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sometimes-offering-equity-employees-most-equitable-solution-muse) directly takes from the bottom line to put value in those folks' pockets! Their respective stakeholder equation seems more than balanced to me.

These individuals likely view themselves as part of a collective responsible for Basecamp's past misdeeds and present policies, which have massive negative externalities on society. Speaking for myself and Rand, even though social impact is difficult to measure, these alleged negative externalities must be microscopic compared to the massive social good Basecamp as an institution does. In sum total, the human rights transgressions don't even register and certainly wash out in [Tyler Cowen's moral economic growth model](https://smile.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135/).

Looking carefully at assumptions and doing the hand-wavy napkin math is important. These practical considerations, in aggregate, affect the future of humankind. Just like how [Bill Gates does the math on Atmosphere Cancer](/bill-gates-climate) with 51 billion as the reference point.

I'm a fan of Basecamp. I'm a fan of Andreessen's essay. I'm a fan of Ayn Rand's book.

I write these blog posts to be evergreen, at least for myself if nobody else. But come June approximately zero people in the target audience of these articles will care about the Basecamp thing or the Elon thing.

The taken-for-granted roads will endure. _Anthem_ was published in 1938, nearing 100 years ago. It will also endure. As will _The Picture of Dorian Gray_, which has a marvelous preface: "When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself."

Thinking about all of this makes me appreciate Seth even more. As a good teacher, he holds a stronger moral view about gently encouraging folks to start thinking and acting systematically. He calls this being an artist and "making a ruckus." He focuses on how he can be useful (unlike me rambling philosophically here) and leaves the final outcomes, the Randian truths, to be proven by destiny and speculated upon by others.


i don't care who or how the road is built, i care about the road as primary concern...
sad how employees don't realize what road they were building, nice how clear it becomes.
maybe career/income mission but not email, or they forgot after taking email for granted
