title: How I Lost A Million Dollars
date: 2021-4-16

I joined [Scale AI](https://scale.com) just before it became a unicorn. This past week, the company [attained a $7B valuation](https://scale.com/blog/series-e).

Not accounting for dilution, the stock options I was offered have grown ~70x in value. To give you an idea, that's like being given $15,000 worth of stock and having it grow to become more than $1,000,000 in less than two years.

If Scale grows even more, to the size of Coinbase for example, then that stock could be easily worth over $10,000,000 someday soon.

It's too bad that I have none of it, because I resigned after less than a year working there.

The thing about founding, or joining an early-stage company, or quitting your nice tech job to go live in the Ecuadorian wilderness, is that it's a big risk.

And folks who are lucky enough to have this luxury to take big risks, to swing for the fences and make big mistakes, such folks are likely to be in such a position that they can surely do it again.



Maybe it's unfair that this kind of opportunity

maybe my thought relating to money is,
I want that too
but then also I want to be happy and whole
to achieve success thoughtfully, do it in a balanced harmonious way
in some sense it would be too easy to just join a company and spend 10 years in tech industry
trying to do something more personally meaningful
more unique
living a life to be proud of
a life to remember
and laugh at
take big risks, make big mistakes
like losing a million dollars
people in such a position can surely do it again





As I was resigning to work at ReadMe, if someone had told me I would get $1-10M to stay, I certainly would have reconsidered

ve stayed at some price, probably, didn't think too much.
but i did say, this is not how I want to be. the company should change, and I should get more. which is false since company didn't change and I didn't contribute so I wasn't really crucial to success.

pretty cool
doing high value work
this was just when i decided capitalism makes sense kinda
paying for stuff is expressing values
money organizes people around ideas

power people here are focused on building stuff and doing interesting things

bitcoin comparable
wealth of experience
not have written book or started podcast, money delays such things

want my wealth to come from my own two hands?
