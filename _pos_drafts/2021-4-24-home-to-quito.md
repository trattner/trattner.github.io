title: Coming Home To Quito
date: 2021-4-24

With an interesting date match on [Voicebar](https://voicebar.co) and the rainy season [pausing my construction project](/construction-strugs), I spontaneously visited San Francisco this month from April 3rd to the 21st.

Coming back to Ecuador this week, I'm reflecting on four themes:
- family
- finances
- fulfillment, and
- falling in love.

Two and half weeks wasn't nearly enough time to spend with my sister...let alone many other friends in SF. Some got very short blocks, and some were completely left out of the visit (sorry!).

I don't yet have a plan to shift back to the U.S. and treat my Ecuadorian habitat as more of a vacation spot, but I now know that if I could magically snap my fingers and improve one relationship, I'd want to grow my bond with Wendy.

Being physically close again highlighted for me how connections deepen through meaningful joint experiences. Even with a sibling whom I've known since her birth, we have so much more room to develop together; the marginal benefit of each shared moment is not going down.

And although a lot can happen virtually, there won't be a substitute for in-person interaction for at least the next decade or two.

Looking years ahead, thinking about family, and grappling with [some tech status benchmarking thoughts](/losing-1m), I'm also re-evaluating my relationship to the working world after 7 months of funemployment.

I've always practiced financial responsibility, but I have also taken a lot more risks than the average young professional. From my experience living a variety of lifestyles, I know that my experimentation needs to yield&mdash;sooner rather than later&mdash;to some form of reliable, responsible income.

My risky, adventurous (some might say low-EV, impulsive) choices have always been aimed at self-actualization. Ever since I discarded my childhood dreams to be a sexy SpaceX engineer&mdash;declining an internship offer my sophomore year of college to build out [Lean On Me](https://lean0n.me) instead&mdash;I have sought to cultivate an engaging day-to-day existence.

Now, with this blog among other things, I have iterated toward projects worth doubling down on. I'm excited to engage more fully and rhythmically with my heart, body, soul on a daily basis to develop my creative [Practice](https://seths.blog/trust-yourself/) and [Turn Pro](https://stevenpressfield.com/books/turning-pro/).

One such project is dating, but it's slowly evolving into a non-project&mdash;its own special category of activity.

For the longest time, I didn't date at all. I couldn't imagine having a girlfriend, and I possessed zero romantic maturity. (This led to all sorts of horrible situations, for which I'm deeply sorry. I watched [_Promising Young Woman_](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/promising_young_woman) on the flight back from SF and got a surprisingly healthy dose of guilty remorse for personifying the toxically masculine white patriarchy. srsly ðŸ˜­)

[_The Defining Decade_](https://smile.amazon.com/Defining-Decade-Your-Twenties-Matter/dp/0446561754/), [_Mars Venus_](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0060574216/), friends, and observations helped me move beyond my multi-faceted naivety. The biggest shift in my motivations was the understanding that a partner can be a positive-sum contributor to one's life, as opposed to a zero-sum competitor against other non-romantic life goals.

So last summer, I decided to start dating properly using apps. But as you can see from my language in the preceding paragraph, I was thinking of romance very intellectually. Compounding this was all the logistics: apps as a tool to stack the top-of-funnel, lots of associated efforts like acquiring non-gym clothes and grooming habits...

Other elements also existed in the mix, of course, such as genuine friendship building and physical attraction. But when my most recent (and expensive) date ended rather quickly and conclusively, I had to question my whole approach.

Thanks to input from my therapist and others, I'm starting to see the dating journey as less of a mechanical process to find a partner. Learning the mechanics of romance has certainly been useful, and perhaps even necessary, but now this whole landscape has transformed to reveal a final frontier: finding love.

Like all men, I need to get more in touch with my feelings. I have to learn how to be more natural in situations where that's not my default approach.

People who know me will say I'm decent at making organic friendships. For example, my first day in Quito yesterday involved befriending some folks who work at the [Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas%C3%ADlica_del_Voto_Nacional). We ended up going for drinks and spent more than four hours hanging out!

I then returned today, accepting the store owner's chess challenge and hospitality: beer + _colada morada_ + great views.

There was also a lovely software engineer who offered to take my photo at the basilica yesterday, and then we had a little coffee date today.

When it comes to romantic interactions, I have a long way to go in .

I've got the friendliness thing down
romantic = friends + backburner focus on life partner + having fun + being in touch with feelings
