We're officially in a post-covid, post-industrial creative economy world
driven by challenging ourselves and each other, shaping our culture

I spitball, great meditation thoughts ==> a new dream
started with job thoughts + seeing my projects (lucas collab especially) fulfilling and being energized this week + seeing Alexis / Lucas as target market of adults who can realize, as well as me but the difference is I'm doing it under my own power

key insight / thesis: learn something new and enjoy yourself, best way is to teach others. first need bit of adulting and skills and articulated desire (write book on x, fix racism and climate change, etc) then we'll get ready by validating or just jump into doing

opportunity is to provide that profile with a little Andy in their pocket, consulting yes and monetize thru services e.g. web hosting, eventually integrating vertically:
- empathetic motivation (a friend but better, a coaching + emotional support / therapist)
- planning and accountability: tailor-fit to your goals and your life circumstances
- expert guidance: we've been there, done that. walking thru the process is the same, but different every time which is why we tailor build to you
- tools and resources: platform to launch your project / business / etc. it all starts with an idea or desire you have, and we'll bring it to life together

I have mentality and can work to custom fit really well with empathy 1:1 or design group system / program, can craft life + brand working with folks, but my weakness is maybe platform / tooling / execution on stuff like marketing for example. for that can raise or partner w Jeffrey etc.

Four stages of life
1. child (naive, ignorant, society + biology + family pushes to adolescence, good times necessarily over soon)
2. adolescent (partial adult, actively trying to adult but probably failing, gaining experience)
3. adult (most people stuck here, have skills, income, self-govern. mature adolescent kinda equilibrium primed for next stage)
4. leader (seth godin self-actualized creator making big contribution to world and fulfilling self and self-employed income stream)

We turn adults into leaders, from zero.

Tools available:
- custom landing page / design
- payments / stripe
- basic apps / interactivity, e.g. scheduling and known other platforms
- A/B testing + content marketing etc (pending my chess w andy project)
- podcast know-how
- book publishing
- coding bootcamp (Lucas style)


my journey is:
1. publish book
2. market books / chess w andy proj
3. rebrand self, do social media w learnings from chessw/andy, re-launch yup & coming maybe w or without career consulting
4. house in order, need job or not after chess learnings, renting, etc.
5. generational company Gen C idea, abstracting out from my personal journey and building an on-deck / akimbo / schoolhouse + career coaching type org to accelerate the future and individuals' happiness, market idea after initial traction and recruit top talent + fundraising, build, automate!
6. get married have kids and actually retire

should be so much value creation that many ways to capture
e.g.
take slice of future earnings
pay people salary to come on board

====
wait list auction: form asking folks to describe their self-employment dream, can they pay, if so how much would they see value (bid) and show highest current. can also ask if they've made self-employed income and how much total, what they know about achieving the dream, what they want help with / don't know, what they see our org doing / value prop / description of what the heck the waitlist is for, etc. keep it simple tho.

general tokenization! meetings create value for both parties. seed from incoming payment, split half (token per dollar) back to meeter and half to org / instructor. adjust payout split with prior on expected value split between two sides, quantifying value to org / network by having new meetings with incoming folks paying X dollars. Seed with my labor and other folks' dollars to meet with me as initial instructor.

general tokens shouldn't govern the org. Some separate system for governance, can be traditional company + shares, just andy dictatorship, or governance tokens which pay dividend for decision-making and value-add controlling backing pool / minting process for new general tokens, operation / mission. Maybe economic board with governance tokens / stakeholders, and separate mission / org vision traditional shares for Andy + investors?

tokenization should help us achieve our mission to be aligned in achieving maximal units of gap-jumping from adult ==> leader. going from leader to super-leader is on-deck or other program, definitely can create more value perhaps but for society and our company, not the vertical we'll target. go upstream. measure this by giving people "graduation" tokens, or some way to certify folks completed the program and are self-employed? not only that but they did it from our work, and are bought in somehow to the ongoing community? Yea I guess we measure income from our work brought to the person by siphoning a percentage or exchanging it with general tokens to benchmark somehow.

how to pay mentors and other network contributors? same for alumni, some measure of value added and what the org gets from them. Maybe give general tokens i guess as payment for contribution.

can pay people at some point, tokens or dollars, subsidizing whole ramp-up process and services with income earned from the humans + ideas, now or in future.

sounds like everything can just be dollars but advantage to tokenization is concrete measuring stick + speculation and public exchange of markets for value of org and its work output.

give back tokens for income proportion as value of service provider like they are doing some upholding of bargain, their side of contract. important: is it a rule or a market?
