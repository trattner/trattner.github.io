How will you get a job after months or years without one?

This reminds me of a similar question I asked myself at age 17, going into senior year of high school: how will I get into a good college if I don't go to school?



I'm not going to class to learn about x subject so I can major in x subject and become a professor in x subject.

I'm not going to work to gain experience in x job so I can become a manager in x job and be the consumate guy in x job.

I'm rather gaining life and personal deepening. Exploring a bit, so that I can better take on x job or subject when the right one comes along, with more perspective and deep understanding of context.

It's not about jumping through hoops and landing in an ever-smaller one, as the specialization shoves forward. It's more about carving a unique story outside of others' definitions, providing unique value and setting my own proposition. Saying my time is infinitely more valuable than your x dollars per hour or your presecripted degree program.

sure, being lazy and there are days when I'm for sure lazy, these things are waste of time and there's nothing to show. But working on a project, building a body of work, taking initiative to set and achieve self-definited goals whatever they are, this creates a story. One that is compelling and granular. Selling book, growing blog, building house, doing stuff...

I'm lucky that I already checked some career boxes, enough so that I'm confident I can go back and work. Not many people have been promoted 3 times in less than a year and managed multi-million dollar relationships / accounts / projects and sales opportunities. I closed deals. And made investments. pre-YC 100% and Interact 100%

Presidential Scholars Program and college, I took a sideways route. Yes I had the pre-requisites, by any measure I was a good student. But the differentiating factors were key, stories of challenge and struggle, stories of calculated initiative and risk, stories of rejecting the mainstream for x y z reasons and showing results. publishing a paper. building a chess club, tutoring folks, running for class president.

And when such things become fun and not so scary as amazing oppotunities, no-brainers, that's when the payoff starts. when you know it's the right choice, to grow and do this exciting stuff which is better than any job anyone could give you.

I hit a plateau in my real jobs, always around or before the 3-6 month mark. This is when you really settle in and have an idea of the job, at month 3, then you try pushing past and at month 6 you realize that you need to be patient with the world around you. before that you're changing yourself and learning and that can be engaging and fast, but then the rubber meets the road and you have to settle into your title and job description and get ready for the longer haul to crank.

I couldn't adapt to such things. I would still be pushing and moving and this isn't what your manager wants...they want someone who will do the job they need done, well. They don't want some revolutionary who wants to steer the whole company in a new direction. Someone who thinks they can do the manager's job better than they can. Someone who will upset the status quo and be re-defining everyone's jobs. Someone who's never satisfied, who's too intense, who's always growing a bit out of the box.

And so there was conflict of fit. I wanted more. I knew I was worth more. Other people didn't know how to channel that, I didn't know how to channel that. And my time and energy are priceless so there's really no end to the comp I would demand.

The only way to really do this is to own my own labor and capture the upside.
Companies are limited, specific and growth within a company can be wide-ranging but also very specific. There's a special kind of sauce that happens with patient people over longer periods and experience, OK, but that doesn't have to be the case. Plenty of world-changing folks show us that and often prove the opposite.

I don't fancy myself world-changing, but maybe I can get a smallest viable audience and that will be enough.

And if I can do that by embracing all parts of me and not just the job output, well then I have succeeded at being me. At putting forth my values through my actions, both unique, and showing results.   

first I need to be sold on myself. for me, that's easy I've been pretty sold since third grade reading under my desk and not listening to the boring slow teacher. Even more sold as a junior in high school and capping out with non-calculus physics saying don't do both physics C AP at once, then I got a 5 and said why am I learning from you. And I got enough feedback from peers etc. pleasant surprise most likely to succeed

identity not very strong at beginning, group belonging, etc.
linked to institutions and others
then eventually realize unique mishmash and go

Success is different for everyone, but mainstream narrative has money, power, happiness, needs being met and life being lived fully. Identity being firm, often aspirationally inclined towards awards or stats or figures. And that's how we sell ourselves to employers and such too, being impressive and fitting a story with dimensions tailored to the job. I'm the best for this job, you want to prove.

Some people have such strong brands and identities, they do things that are very them. Musicians like Dodie, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles??

====== orig prompt ======
resume and hiring after book sales, having a story and college apps etc, selling your story and building a body of work...more exciting for me to do this vs readme, proving self too smart need to do othrt things if not managing
