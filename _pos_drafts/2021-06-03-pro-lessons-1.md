The first chapter of Pressfield's _Turning Pro_ is 5 lines long. It describes the titular "human condition" through analogy with a robot that just learned to recognize its reflection.

Per Jon Stewart, "When the robot learns to hate what it sees it will have achieved full humanity."

Pressfield's ironic    Jon Stewart

The robot recognizes its reflection and is commentary says when it learns to hate what it sees then it will have achieved humanity.

It is supposed as a two step process from self-awareness to self-hatred.

Pressfield is hinting at the basic premise of artistic and self-actualizing challenge. Namely, that we have desires and thoughts and our cognition gets in out own way, quite comitcally, when we are adrift in nature's current of shaming and dreaming too big and looking in the mirror instaed of doing our work.

Like the buddha, meditation being enlightenment itself, Pressfield will tell us that doing the work is itself both journey and destination.

Lesson one must be therefore: stop looking in the mirrror.
